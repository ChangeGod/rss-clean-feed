      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Knives Out For Hegseth: New Allegations Of OPSEC Failures, Pentagon Mismanagement&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is taking heavy fire once again.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In what looks like a coordinated attack&lt;/strong&gt;, Sunday brought a sensational new allegation of Hegseth violating operational security (OPSEC) ahead of the March 15 US strikes on Yemen, and an op-ed from a former Hegseth advocate calling for his removal over &quot;total chaos at the Pentagon.&quot; While it&apos;s hard to discern motives in DC&apos;s &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; intrigue, the renewed assault comes after &lt;strong&gt;Hegseth reportedly helped dissuade President Trump from launching Israel&apos;s long-pursued US war on Iran&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, Hegseth found himself in the middle of a media and political firestorm after &lt;strong&gt;he unwittingly shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-atlantic-war-plans-signal-yemen-houthis-c0addd08c627ab01a37ea63621cb695e&quot;&gt;detailed information&lt;/a&gt; about pending US strikes on Yemen with &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; editor Jeffrey Goldberg&lt;/strong&gt; -- who was errantly added to a Signal group chat for top officials by national security advisor Mike Waltz . Hegseth didn&apos;t do himself any favors by downplaying the report and attempting to obfuscate the facts of the scandal -- for example, using wordplay to claim &quot;nobody was texting war plans,&quot; but rather minute-by-minute details of the attack. Goldberg&apos;s inclusion aside, &lt;strong&gt;the use of a common smartphone app to discuss such sensitive details was controversial by itself&lt;/strong&gt;, raising concerns not only about OPSEC, but also records retention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/pete%20jennifer%20hegseth.jpeg?itok=uaQW-ccw&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/pete%20jennifer%20hegseth.jpeg?itok=uaQW-ccw&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ac477a06-fd7e-4e5a-8d22-534f04e5463b&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;352&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/pete%20jennifer%20hegseth.jpeg?itok=uaQW-ccw&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did civilian Jennifer Hegseth have a need to know the 1st strike package of F-18s would launch at 12:15 ET on March 15, and that &quot;THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP&quot; AT 1415, as Hegseth texted her and his brother? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to Sunday, when a double-tap attack on Hegseth&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;started with a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report that&lt;strong&gt; Hegseth shared substantially identical, advance details about the March 15 strikes with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/hegseth-yemen-attack-second-signal-chat.html&quot;&gt;a second Signal chat group&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-signal-chat-houthis-attack-8dbf9dd6c711796438a5c1c84831c40b&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; members included his wife Jennifer, brother Phil and personal lawyer Tim Parlatore&lt;/strong&gt;. Citing four sources familiar with this group chat and its contents, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/hegseth-yemen-attack-second-signal-chat.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that this group -- labelled &quot;Defense/Team Huddle&quot; -- was created by Hegseth himself, who accessed it with his private phone, not his government one.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While his personal lawyer and brother have DOD jobs, neither seemingly had a &quot;need to know&quot; about the attacks. Hegseth appointed Parlatore as a Navy Reserve JAG Commander, with a focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/05/us/trump-news?searchResultPosition=7#hegseths-personal-lawyer-to-be-commissioned-as-a-navy-commander-in-the-reserves&quot;&gt;improving the training&lt;/a&gt; of JAG officers. Phil Hegseth is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2025/03/28/hegseths-younger-brother-is-serving-in-a-key-role-inside-the-pentagon/&quot;&gt;DOD liaison with the Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; -- a post that hardly suggests a need to know about the imminent strike, much less a timeline &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-atlantic-war-plans-signal-yemen-houthis-c0addd08c627ab01a37ea63621cb695e&quot;&gt;detailing&lt;/a&gt; that F-18s, MQ-9 Reaper drones and Tomahawk cruise missiles would be used. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;strong&gt;this scenario seems to indicate a Secretary of Defense excitedly and unjustifiably sharing inside info with his wife and confidants&lt;/strong&gt;. Validating his confirmation-opponents&apos; attacks on his lack of experience, the decision seems consistent with a SecDef whose own top military rank was &lt;a href=&quot;https://ballotpedia.org/Pete_Hegseth&quot;&gt;Major&lt;/a&gt; in the National Guard. Meanwhile, the Signal chat about Yemen isn&apos;t the first time &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Hegseth&apos;s involvement in her husband&apos;s job has raised eyebrows&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/hegseth-brought-his-wife-to-sensitive-meetings-with-foreign-military-officials-c16db0ea&quot;&gt;Questions have also been raised over why Jennifer -- a former &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt; producer with no DOD job -- has participated in multiple meetings that covered sensitive topics&lt;/a&gt;, including one with the head of UK&apos;s military to discuss terminating the sharing of intelligence with Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/ullyot-hegseth.jpeg?itok=U5CzzD2i&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ullyot-hegseth.jpeg?itok=U5CzzD2i&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;5e3eb579-67b8-416f-bdbb-8122c1b76f04&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;318&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ullyot-hegseth.jpeg?itok=U5CzzD2i&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Ullyot -- who publicly advocated for Hegseth&apos;s confirmation -- now says Trump should dump him over Pentagon &quot;dysfunction&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second half of the weekend blitz against Hegseth came in the form of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/04/20/pentagon-chaos-ullyot-hegseth-00205594&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; op-ed written by John Ullyot&lt;/strong&gt;, a former champion of Hegseth who resigned from a Department of Defense public affairs role last month. He described the last month as &quot;total chaos at the Pentagon,&quot; saying that, given President Trump&apos;s &quot;strong record of holding his top officials to account...&lt;strong&gt;it’s hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role&lt;/strong&gt; for much longer.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the poor OPSEC of &quot;Signalgate&quot; and Hegseth&apos;s attempt to use a &quot;vague, Clinton-esque non-denial denial&quot; of the scandal, Hegseth focused on &lt;strong&gt;last week&apos;s firing of three top Pentagon staffers&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;senior adviser Dan Caldwell, deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick and chief of staff Colin Carroll. Ullyot wrote that Hegseth loyalists &quot;tried to smear the aides anonymously,&quot; dishonestly accusing them of leaking sensitive information. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Hegseth’s team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; wrote Ullyot. The &quot;strange and baffling purge&quot; is causing &quot;disarray,&quot; wrote Ullyot, who also called out the odd inclusion of Hegseth&apos;s wife in sensitive meetings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;The president deserves better than the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://jel.jewish-languages.org/words/382&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;mishegoss&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the Pentagon,&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;concluded Ullyot. &quot;Given his record of holding prior Cabinet leaders accountable, many in the secretary’s own inner circle will applaud quietly if Trump [fires Hegseth].&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No matter how much credence you attach to substance of these attacks on Hegseth, it&apos;s smart to consider the possible motives&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;of those who are participating in them:&lt;/strong&gt; the four people volunteering details about the newly-revealed Signal group chat, Hegseth cheerleader-turned-assailant John Ullyot, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and especially &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; -- an outlet with a record of advancing the Deep State agenda. (Never forget the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/hunter-biden-story-russian-disinfo-430276&quot;&gt;Oct 19 2020 &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; headline: &quot;Hunter Biden Story is Russian Disinfo, Dozens of Former Intel Officials Say.&quot;)   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On one front, Hegseth is going all-out on behalf of the national security apparatus&lt;/strong&gt;, joining Trump in a campaign to throw perhaps every dollar of DOGE savings into a Pentagon rathole in a bid to push the DOD budget beyond $1 trillion:&lt;/p&gt;

Contemplating the specter of such an attack sparking an all-out war, Trump opted to give diplomacy a chance. &lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Knives Out For Hegseth: New Allegations Of OPSEC Failures, Pentagon Mismanagement

            
Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is taking heavy fire once again. In what looks like a coordinated attack, Sunday brought a sensational new allegation of Hegseth violating operational security (OPSEC) ahead of the March 15 US strikes on Yemen, and an op-ed from a former Hegseth advocate calling for his removal over &quot;total chaos at the Pentagon.&quot; While it&apos;s hard to discern motives in DC&apos;s House of Cards intrigue, the renewed assault comes after Hegseth reportedly helped dissuade President Trump from launching Israel&apos;s long-pursued US war on Iran. 
Last month, Hegseth found himself in the middle of a media and political firestorm after he unwittingly shared detailed information about pending US strikes on Yemen with Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg -- who was errantly added to a Signal group chat for top officials by national security advisor Mike Waltz . Hegseth didn&apos;t do himself any favors by downplaying the report and attempting to obfuscate the facts of the scandal -- for example, using wordplay to claim &quot;nobody was texting war plans,&quot; but rather minute-by-minute details of the attack. Goldberg&apos;s inclusion aside, the use of a common smartphone app to discuss such sensitive details was controversial by itself, raising concerns not only about OPSEC, but also records retention. 
Did civilian Jennifer Hegseth have a need to know the 1st strike package of F-18s would launch at 12:15 ET on March 15, and that &quot;THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP&quot; AT 1415, as Hegseth texted her and his brother? 


Fast-forward to Sunday, when a double-tap attack on Hegseth started with a New York Times report that Hegseth shared substantially identical, advance details about the March 15 strikes with a second Signal chat group, whose 13 members included his wife Jennifer, brother Phil and personal lawyer Tim Parlatore. Citing four sources familiar with this group chat and its contents, the Times reported that this group -- labelled &quot;Defense/Team Huddle&quot; -- was created by Hegseth himself, who accessed it with his private phone, not his government one.  
While his personal lawyer and brother have DOD jobs, neither seemingly had a &quot;need to know&quot; about the attacks. Hegseth appointed Parlatore as a Navy Reserve JAG Commander, with a focus on improving the training of JAG officers. Phil Hegseth is a DOD liaison with the Department of Homeland Security -- a post that hardly suggests a need to know about the imminent strike, much less a timeline detailing that F-18s, MQ-9 Reaper drones and Tomahawk cruise missiles would be used. 
In other words, this scenario seems to indicate a Secretary of Defense excitedly and unjustifiably sharing inside info with his wife and confidants. Validating his confirmation-opponents&apos; attacks on his lack of experience, the decision seems consistent with a SecDef whose own top military rank was Major in the National Guard. Meanwhile, the Signal chat about Yemen isn&apos;t the first time Jennifer Hegseth&apos;s involvement in her husband&apos;s job has raised eyebrows. Questions have also been raised over why Jennifer -- a former Fox News producer with no DOD job -- has participated in multiple meetings that covered sensitive topics, including one with the head of UK&apos;s military to discuss terminating the sharing of intelligence with Ukraine. 
John Ullyot -- who publicly advocated for Hegseth&apos;s confirmation -- now says Trump should dump him over Pentagon &quot;dysfunction&quot;


The second half of the weekend blitz against Hegseth came in the form of a Politico op-ed written by John Ullyot, a former champion of Hegseth who resigned from a Department of Defense public affairs role last month.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The US might cut off military aid to Ukraine while suspending its strategic resource talks with Russia...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2826%29_4.jpg?itok=CAQT1cM9&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2826%29_4.jpg?itok=CAQT1cM9&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;91a21023-ddb9-4794-9227-4cae9c01a1e9&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2826%29_4.jpg?itok=CAQT1cM9&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/18/europe/rubio-russia-war-in-ukraine-us-talks-intl-hnk/index.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that the US might stop mediating an end to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thealtworld.com/andrew_korybko/heres-what-i-learned-from-analyzing-the-new-cold-war-every-day-for-three-years-straight&quot;&gt;Ukrainian Conflict&lt;/a&gt; if it concludes within “a matter of days” that no peace deal is doable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That coincided with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/hdOfc&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; reporting that Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff told them that “Putin had been fixated on Ukrainian land in their discussions. He said that Russia might get some of the regions, but not all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis &lt;a href=&quot;https://korybko.substack.com/p/lavrov-elaborated-on-russias-envisaged&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; explained why it’s so important for Russia to obtain full control over the disputed lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If no breakthrough is achieved, such as the US coercing Ukraine into withdrawing from those regions or Russia agreeing to freeze this dimension of the conflict, then the US might indeed abandon its peace efforts. &lt;/strong&gt;The question therefore arises of how that could change its relations with Ukraine and Russia. Beginning with the first, Trump and his team’s explicitly expressed exhaustion with this conflict bodes ill for the scenario of the US continuing military support for Ukraine, which would please Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Europeans would try to replace some of this lost aid&lt;/strong&gt; in order to keep the conflict going in alignment with Zelensky’s vision, but they’d be unable to replace all of it and he might ultimately be forced into agreeing to worse terms than the US’ if Russia successfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://korybko.substack.com/p/will-russia-expand-its-ground-campaign&quot;&gt;expands its ground offensive&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, however, the US might also suspend its talks with Russia on the strategic resource deals that were supposed to serve as the centerpiece of their planned “&lt;a href=&quot;https://korybko.substack.com/p/russia-and-the-us-diplomatic-choreography&quot;&gt;New&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://korybko.substack.com/p/korybko-to-newsweek-a-russian-us&quot;&gt;Détente&lt;/a&gt;” as long as the conflict continues&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This balanced approach would be predicated on pressuring Ukraine and Russia into committing to compromises aimed at restoring the US-led peace talks since the first doesn’t want to lose territory in other regions while the second is interested in shaping the post-conflict era in partnership with the US. These evidently aren’t their top priorities, however, otherwise the land issue would have already been resolved one way or another and there wouldn’t be any talk of the US abandoning its peace efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other than the unlikely scenario of the US “escalating to de-escalate” on better terms for Ukraine, another comparatively more probable one exists but which is still less likely than the aforesaid, and that’s the US discontinuing military support for Ukraine but continuing resource talks with Russia.&lt;/strong&gt; These negotiations are connected to Ukraine since the US is seeking privileged terms from Russia in exchange for coercing Kiev into Moscow’s demanded concessions but can still proceed even if that doesn’t occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why this scenario is considered less likely than the balanced one described above is because some of the US’ sanctions that impede the clinching of resource deals with Russia can’t easily be lifted without first bringing about an end to the Ukrainian Conflict. Moreover, sanctions relief and the prospect of jointly shaping the post-conflict era are the only carrots that the US can dangle for incentivizing Russia to compromise on ending the conflict, which Trump wants it to do for solidifying his global legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s therefore expected to at least temporarily suspend such talks with Russia for that reason in that scenario but might resume them if the conflict remains protracted with no clear diplomatic or military solution. That would make the most sense since &lt;strong&gt;he wouldn’t prematurely give up the only means that the US has for incentivizing Russia to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thealtworld.com/andrew_korybko/will-putin-agree-to-a-ceasefire&quot;&gt;compromise for peace&lt;/a&gt; but he also wouldn’t lose the objective economic and strategic benefits that a resource deal would bring.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>How Might Washington&apos;s Relations With Ukraine &amp; Russia Change If It Abandons Its Peace Efforts?

            
Authored by Andrew Korybko via substack,
The US might cut off military aid to Ukraine while suspending its strategic resource talks with Russia...



Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday that the US might stop mediating an end to the Ukrainian Conflict if it concludes within “a matter of days” that no peace deal is doable.
That coincided with the Wall Street Journal reporting that Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff told them that “Putin had been fixated on Ukrainian land in their discussions. He said that Russia might get some of the regions, but not all.”
This analysis here explained why it’s so important for Russia to obtain full control over the disputed lands.
If no breakthrough is achieved, such as the US coercing Ukraine into withdrawing from those regions or Russia agreeing to freeze this dimension of the conflict, then the US might indeed abandon its peace efforts. The question therefore arises of how that could change its relations with Ukraine and Russia. Beginning with the first, Trump and his team’s explicitly expressed exhaustion with this conflict bodes ill for the scenario of the US continuing military support for Ukraine, which would please Russia.
The Europeans would try to replace some of this lost aid in order to keep the conflict going in alignment with Zelensky’s vision, but they’d be unable to replace all of it and he might ultimately be forced into agreeing to worse terms than the US’ if Russia successfully expands its ground offensive. At the same time, however, the US might also suspend its talks with Russia on the strategic resource deals that were supposed to serve as the centerpiece of their planned “New Détente” as long as the conflict continues
This balanced approach would be predicated on pressuring Ukraine and Russia into committing to compromises aimed at restoring the US-led peace talks since the first doesn’t want to lose territory in other regions while the second is interested in shaping the post-conflict era in partnership with the US. These evidently aren’t their top priorities, however, otherwise the land issue would have already been resolved one way or another and there wouldn’t be any talk of the US abandoning its peace efforts.
Other than the unlikely scenario of the US “escalating to de-escalate” on better terms for Ukraine, another comparatively more probable one exists but which is still less likely than the aforesaid, and that’s the US discontinuing military support for Ukraine but continuing resource talks with Russia.

Earlier this year, he experienced a severe health crisis that resulted in over a month of hospitalization due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/medical/pope-franciss-condition-worsens-after-respiratory-crisis-vatican&quot;&gt;double pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Dearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis. At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favor of the poorest and most marginalized. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pope Francis&apos; clinical situation gradually worsened, and his doctors diagnosed bilateral pneumonia on Tuesday, February 18.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After 38 days in hospital, the late Pope returned to his Vatican residence at the Casa Santa Marta to continue his recovery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To his 1.3 billion followers, Francis signaled a more inclusive stance toward LGBTQ+ Catholics and advocated for open borders in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout his tenure (March 13, 2013 to April 21, 2025), Francis also spoke about multiple recurring themes, including compassion, humility, and advocacy. He told followers, &quot;My people are poor, and I am one of them.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance met with Francis to exchange Easter greetings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know you have not been feeling great, but it&apos;s good to see you in better health,&quot; Vance told the Pope, adding, &quot;Thank you for seeing me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Pope Francis Dead At 88 

            
Vatican News reports that Pope Francis died at the age of 88 at 7:35 a.m. local time (1:35 a.m. EST). Earlier this year, he experienced a severe health crisis that resulted in over a month of hospitalization due to double pneumonia.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/dxy%20dollar%20index%202.jpg?itok=mdtOyQBR&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/dxy%20dollar%20index%202.jpg?itok=mdtOyQBR&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;2b2d59b5-55c8-4586-ae76-8bfc0dfb549f&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;312&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/dxy%20dollar%20index%202.jpg?itok=mdtOyQBR&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no specific catalyst for the suddenly collapse in the illiquid early Asian session, which sees many countries on extended Easter holiday, Bloomberg quotes traders that hedge funds are selling the dollar against virtually any currencies after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that President Donald Trump is still exploring ways to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The president and his team will continue to study that,” National Economic Council Director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-18/trump-studying-whether-removing-powell-is-option-hassett-says&quot;&gt;Kevin Hassett said Friday&lt;/a&gt; when asked by a reporter if removing Powell was an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hassett then suggested, accurately, that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The policy of this Federal Reserve was to raise rates the minute President Trump was elected last time, to say that the supply-side tax cuts that were going to be inflationary,” Hassett said, adding that Fed officials opted not to go “on TV and at IMF meetings and warn about the terrible inflation from the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden, and the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden was textbook inflationary,” Hassett continued. “And then they cut rates right ahead of the election.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hassett, is of course, correct, as we first pointed out two weeks ago...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=8dJuF5ff&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=8dJuF5ff&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;6ba74330-a6a9-4143-b749-e83364dc6640&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=8dJuF5ff&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and, of course, gold which is storming to new record highs this evening, spiking above $3,373, its dip last week now a distant memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/gold%20usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=fWXgLfSJ&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/gold%20usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=fWXgLfSJ&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;085b99b0-98ad-4095-af14-4d3cfa11c1cd&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/gold%20usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=fWXgLfSJ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet none of these moves are surprising to anyone who read - as we repeatedly urged - the Miran Mar-A-Lago paper: yes, the plunge in the dollar is just what the admin quietly wants (they have repeatedly stated they want a strong dollar &quot;in the long term&quot;, but certainly not in the short, when the collapse in the greenback will boost US exports). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, if Powell will not cut rates to ease financial conditions, Trump&apos;s repeated browbeating of the Fed chair and threats to fire him will crash the dollar low enough to where Trump will get his financial easing one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there was one notable outlier in tonight&apos;s Dollar selloff: bitcoin. While previously any plunge in the dollar (and by extension surge in the yen) would batter what was little is left of the carry trade, hammering tech stocks and cryptos, tonight we finally saw a regime shift, and after flatlining initially, a burst of buying pushed bitcoin almost $2000 higher, above $87000, and its biggest one day move since Liberation Day...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/bitcoin%20snaps.jpg?itok=aSFVJ-X-&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/bitcoin%20snaps.jpg?itok=aSFVJ-X-&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;8a912e88-4dca-4189-a077-3f3e4c659fcc&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/bitcoin%20snaps.jpg?itok=aSFVJ-X-&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and the result is that while bitcoin had generally tracked the DXY Dollar index lower for much of 2025, the last few weeks - and certainly Sunday night - have seen a very tangible snap in this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/dollar%20vs%20bitcoin.jpg?itok=tHC7FNse&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/dollar%20vs%20bitcoin.jpg?itok=tHC7FNse&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;b4402399-1624-4822-b5da-8685d600ed39&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/dollar%20vs%20bitcoin.jpg?itok=tHC7FNse&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This breach in the right correlation between the two, suggests that with gold approaching ridiculous prices, the next flight to safety away from the collapsing dollar will be bitcoin - after all, &lt;strong&gt;it&apos;s only a matter of time before all other central banks unleash a money printing frenzy to hammer their own currencies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since all bitcoin needs is a little unexpected upside to spark a huge short squeeze and to get the momentum trades piling on, should today&apos;s phase reversal sustain for a few days, we may see new all time highs in bitcoin in a very short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait... because the real fun for non-fiat assets will start once other central banks - such as the BOJ and ECB - can no longer just sit and watch as the dollar disintegrates, pushing their own currencies into the stratosphere and killing their economies... and they retaliate by restarting the next round of global fiat debasement first by slashing rates and then by restarting the money printer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Dollar Crashes On Powell Removal Speculation, Gold Soars To All Time High And Bitcoin Suddenly Spikes

            
What was a miserable shortened week for the USD has gone from bad to worse in early Asia trading, when the Dollar index suddenly collapsed to a fresh 3 year low



While there is no specific catalyst for the suddenly collapse in the illiquid early Asian session, which sees many countries on extended Easter holiday, Bloomberg quotes traders that hedge funds are selling the dollar against virtually any currencies after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that President Donald Trump is still exploring ways to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to traders.
“The president and his team will continue to study that,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday when asked by a reporter if removing Powell was an option.
Hassett then suggested, accurately, that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats.
“The policy of this Federal Reserve was to raise rates the minute President Trump was elected last time, to say that the supply-side tax cuts that were going to be inflationary,” Hassett said, adding that Fed officials opted not to go “on TV and at IMF meetings and warn about the terrible inflation from the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden, and the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden was textbook inflationary,” Hassett continued. “And then they cut rates right ahead of the election.”
Hassett, is of course, correct, as we first pointed out two weeks ago...

... as Bank of America&apos;s Michael Hartnett pointed out on Friday...
Fed cut 50bps in Sept when stock market at record high, Atlanta Fed was forecasting +3% US GDP growth; Fed now determined not to cut rates after 20% market plunge, Atlanta Fed forecasting -3% GDP growth
... and as former NY Fed president Bill Dudley made crystal clear all the way back in 2019.
The day is August 27, 2019. Former NY Fed president Bill Dudley writes a Bloomberg oped saying &quot;the Fed shouldn&apos;t enable Donald Trump&quot; and urged the central bank not to &quot;provide offsetting stimulus&quot; in Trump&apos;s trade war with China.

But since the market is terrified of the truth, especially if it means that Trump could take monetary policy actions into his own hands, the result has been a wholesale liquidation of all main currency pairs, with the EUR jumping to 3 year highs, even though Europe&apos;s economy remains an unmitigated disaster (Germany&apos;s upcoming debt spending spree notwithstanding), and even though the surge in the euro will make Europe&apos;s modest recession into a brutal one..



... the Yen surging 11% from its January lows, and at just over 141, the highest it has been against the dollar since the summer of 2023...



... and, of course, gold which is storming to new record highs this evening, spiking above $3,373, its dip last week now a distant memory.



Yet none of these moves are surprising to anyone who read - as we repeatedly urged - the Miran Mar-A-Lago paper: yes, the plunge in the dollar is just what the admin quietly wants (they have repeatedly stated they want a strong dollar &quot;in the long term&quot;, but certainly not in the short, when the collapse in the greenback will boost US exports).

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;The Failure Of The Expert Class... Again&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amgreatness.com/2025/04/19/the-failure-of-the-expert-classagain/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Stephen Soukup via American Greatness,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week, &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; ran an excellent, helpful, and important &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/school-closures-predictable-disaster/682431/?taid=68010ce6a6bd180001eec999&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_content=true-anthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by David Zweig, excerpted from his forthcoming book &lt;em&gt;An Abundance of Caution&lt;/em&gt;, which is, at least superficially, about the coronavirus pandemic and the school closures it prompted. &lt;strong&gt;Zweig denies that it is about the pandemic specifically, saying that it is, rather, about “&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davidzweig/status/1912883364064903303&quot;&gt;the failure of the expert class&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever the case, Zweig is unsparing in his criticism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without sufficient acknowledgment of the harms of school closures or adequate planning for unwinding this intervention, officials showed that their decisions to close were simply reactive rather than carefully considered. The decision makers set a radical project in motion with no plan on how to stop it. In effect, officials steered a car off the road, threw a cinder block on the accelerator, then jumped out of the vehicle with passengers still in the back. No one was in the front or even knew how to unstick the pedal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The main point of Zweig’s case is that the so-called expert class was not particularly expert in this instance, which is to say that the damage it did was predictable and therefore preventable. &lt;/strong&gt;Those in charge, whom we were all urged constantly to “trust,” were either ignorant of existing literature warning of the consequences of the actions they were taking or arrogant enough to think that they could produce outcomes different from those previously forecast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the end, the “experts” failed the nation and especially its children, who suffered disproportionately from their arrogance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_14-30-28.jpg?itok=rKTT3xym&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_14-30-28.jpg?itok=rKTT3xym&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;3e144270-6fe3-4a1c-8b8d-d7baaddeb044&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-20_14-30-28.jpg?itok=rKTT3xym&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zweig is right, almost inarguably, and I look forward to reading his book. Nevertheless, I would take his case even a step further, suggesting that the problem is bigger than an arrogant and out-of-touch expert class. The problem, rather, is the largely unique American tradition that insists that expertise and politics must be distinct from one another, and that when they clash, &lt;strong&gt;the narrowness of expertise must take precedence over the girth and depth of the democratic crowd.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID pandemic is not the first time that the American people have been let down and dragged down a dark road by their purportedly brilliant experts. Indeed, the defining event of the Baby Boom generation is, perhaps, the greatest (though hardly the only) example of previous “failures of the expert class.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Americans’ faith in experts and the expert class likely hit its zenith in the 1950s, a decade in which almost anything seemed possible. &lt;/strong&gt;America had defeated the Nazis and Imperial Japanese. It had rescued Europe from its war and the post-war destruction. It was strong and tough and, of course, it possessed the brightest scientists and the mightiest weapons in all of human history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On his best-known solo album, &lt;em&gt;The Nightfly&lt;/em&gt;, Steely Dan co-founder Donald Fagen reminisced about those days and the promise they held. For example, in “I.G.Y.,” he muses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing tough under stars and stripes&lt;br /&gt;
We can tell&lt;br /&gt;
This dream’s in sight&lt;br /&gt;
You’ve got to admit it&lt;br /&gt;
At this point in time that it’s clear&lt;br /&gt;
The future looks bright&lt;br /&gt;
On that train all graphite and glitter&lt;br /&gt;
Undersea by rail&lt;br /&gt;
Ninety minutes from New York to Paris&lt;br /&gt;
Well by seventy-six we’ll be A. O. K….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A just machine to make big decisions&lt;br /&gt;
Programmed by fellows with compassion and vision&lt;br /&gt;
We’ll be clean when their work is done&lt;br /&gt;
We’ll be eternally free yes and eternally young….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The I, the G, and the Y in the title of Fagen’s song refer to the “International Geophysical Year,” which was an 18-month-long scientific exchange celebration that ran from July 1957 to December 1958. The project was meant to take advantage of a reprieve in Cold War tensions to demonstrate to the world how science could produce lasting peace and harmony. The Soviets spoiled the peace and harmony bit by launching Sputnik three months later, sooner than the Americans could launch their satellite propelled by the rockets of Project Vanguard. In a fitting twist to the utopian agitprop of the IGY project, in response to Sputnik and to Vanguard’s failures, the United States turned, at last, to one of its greatest “experts” on rocket design, the erstwhile Nazi Wernher von Braun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course, most Americans didn’t know about Braun, and so their illusions about the “experts” remained unshattered&lt;/strong&gt;. In 1960, they elected a man and an administration that would come to epitomize the hope and the faith they placed in their experts. David Halberstam put it as follows in his classic &lt;em&gt;The Best and the Brightest&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We seemed about to enter an Olympian age in this country, brains and intellect harnessed to great force, the better to define a common good… It seems long ago now, that excitement which swept through the country, or at least the intellectual reaches of it, that feeling that America was going to change, that the government had been handed down from the tired, flabby chamber-of-commerce mentality of the Eisenhower years to the best and brightest of a generation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Fates and Nemesis would have it, however, it was the best and brightest who, in their arrogance and insularity, eventually shattered the expertise illusion with their debacle in Vietnam. Again, Halberstam wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no small irony here: An administration which flaunted its intellectual superiority and its superior academic credentials made the most critical of decisions with virtually no input from anyone who had any expertise on the recent history of that part of the world, and it in no way factored in the entire experience of the French Indochina War. Part of the reason for this were the upheavals of the McCarthy period, but in part it was also the arrogance of men of the Atlantic; it was as if these men did not need to know about such a distant and somewhat less worthy part of the world. Lesser parts of the world attracted lesser men; years later I came upon a story which illustrated this theory perfectly. Jack Langguth, a writer and college classmate of mine, mentioned to a member of that Administration that he was thinking of going on to study Latin American history. The man had turned to him, his contempt barely concealed, and said, “Second-rate parts of the world for second-rate minds.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle between the “rule of experts” and the rule of the people dates, like most of the dreadful battles in our society, to the dawn of the Progressive Era and the musings of Richard Ely and Woodrow Wilson. The expert class they envisioned proved to be a disaster, just as the Best and the Brightest did—and just as the health and education experts did during COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As I say, the problem here isn’t expertise &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. Expertise is invaluable, obviously. Rather, the problem is the belief that expertise conveys both infallibility and moral superiority and, therefore, should—always and everywhere—be considered superior to the will of the people.&lt;/strong&gt; Again, this is an artifact of Progressivism, and as important and insightful as books like David Zweig’s may be, they will not alter the dysfunctional operation of our system until we address this original sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <contentSnippet>The Failure Of The Expert Class... Again

            
Authored by Stephen Soukup via American Greatness,
This past week, The Atlantic ran an excellent, helpful, and important piece by David Zweig, excerpted from his forthcoming book An Abundance of Caution, which is, at least superficially, about the coronavirus pandemic and the school closures it prompted. Zweig denies that it is about the pandemic specifically, saying that it is, rather, about “the failure of the expert class.” Whatever the case, Zweig is unsparing in his criticism:
Without sufficient acknowledgment of the harms of school closures or adequate planning for unwinding this intervention, officials showed that their decisions to close were simply reactive rather than carefully considered. The decision makers set a radical project in motion with no plan on how to stop it. In effect, officials steered a car off the road, threw a cinder block on the accelerator, then jumped out of the vehicle with passengers still in the back. No one was in the front or even knew how to unstick the pedal.
The main point of Zweig’s case is that the so-called expert class was not particularly expert in this instance, which is to say that the damage it did was predictable and therefore preventable. Those in charge, whom we were all urged constantly to “trust,” were either ignorant of existing literature warning of the consequences of the actions they were taking or arrogant enough to think that they could produce outcomes different from those previously forecast.

Zweig is right, almost inarguably, and I look forward to reading his book. Nevertheless, I would take his case even a step further, suggesting that the problem is bigger than an arrogant and out-of-touch expert class. The problem, rather, is the largely unique American tradition that insists that expertise and politics must be distinct from one another, and that when they clash, the narrowness of expertise must take precedence over the girth and depth of the democratic crowd.
The COVID pandemic is not the first time that the American people have been let down and dragged down a dark road by their purportedly brilliant experts.

In a fitting twist to the utopian agitprop of the IGY project, in response to Sputnik and to Vanguard’s failures, the United States turned, at last, to one of its greatest “experts” on rocket design, the erstwhile Nazi Wernher von Braun.
Of course, most Americans didn’t know about Braun, and so their illusions about the “experts” remained unshattered. In 1960, they elected a man and an administration that would come to epitomize the hope and the faith they placed in their experts. David Halberstam put it as follows in his classic The Best and the Brightest:
We seemed about to enter an Olympian age in this country, brains and intellect harnessed to great force, the better to define a common good… It seems long ago now, that excitement which swept through the country, or at least the intellectual reaches of it, that feeling that America was going to change, that the government had been handed down from the tired, flabby chamber-of-commerce mentality of the Eisenhower years to the best and brightest of a generation.
As the Fates and Nemesis would have it, however, it was the best and brightest who, in their arrogance and insularity, eventually shattered the expertise illusion with their debacle in Vietnam. Again, Halberstam wrote:
There is no small irony here: An administration which flaunted its intellectual superiority and its superior academic credentials made the most critical of decisions with virtually no input from anyone who had any expertise on the recent history of that part of the world, and it in no way factored in the entire experience of the French Indochina War. Part of the reason for this were the upheavals of the McCarthy period, but in part it was also the arrogance of men of the Atlantic; it was as if these men did not need to know about such a distant and somewhat less worthy part of the world. Lesser parts of the world attracted lesser men; years later I came upon a story which illustrated this theory perfectly. Jack Langguth, a writer and college classmate of mine, mentioned to a member of that Administration that he was thinking of going on to study Latin American history. The man had turned to him, his contempt barely concealed, and said, “Second-rate parts of the world for second-rate minds.”
The battle between the “rule of experts” and the rule of the people dates, like most of the dreadful battles in our society, to the dawn of the Progressive Era and the musings of Richard Ely and Woodrow Wilson. The expert class they envisioned proved to be a disaster, just as the Best and the Brightest did—and just as the health and education experts did during COVID.
As I say, the problem here isn’t expertise per se. Expertise is invaluable, obviously. Rather, the problem is the belief that expertise conveys both infallibility and moral superiority and, therefore, should—always and everywhere—be considered superior to the will of the people. Again, this is an artifact of Progressivism, and as important and insightful as books like David Zweig’s may be, they will not alter the dysfunctional operation of our system until we address this original sin.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Tesla To Offer &quot;Company Update&quot; With Tuesday&apos;s Earnings Report: What To Watch&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla has set its Q1 2025 earnings call for Tuesday, April 22, at 4:30 p.m. CT / 5:30 p.m. ET. As usual, the event will be livestreamed, with a recording available later on Tesla’s website. The Q1 Update Letter will be released after markets close that same day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quarter, as multiple Tesla blogs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-company-update-q1-earnings-call-date/&quot;&gt;Teslarati&lt;/a&gt; have pointed out, Tesla is also adding a new element: a “Company Update.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, the term appeared in both its vehicle delivery report and on the company’s official X account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In addition to posting first quarter results, Tesla management &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;will hold a live company update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and question and answer webcast that day,” the company stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation is growing that Tesla may use the update to reveal more about its upcoming projects, particularly the affordable EVs teased in its Q4 2024 report: “Plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025...”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings are expected to show a 4.4% decline in profit to $0.43 per share, with revenue holding steady at $21.45 billion, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyst estimates range from $0.30 to $0.51 per share, but consensus has dropped over 40% since late 2024. Piper Sandler warned the results will “likely underwhelm,” with margins “probably trending near multiyear lows.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/musk1234.jpg?itok=TXkSEBO_&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/musk1234.jpg?itok=TXkSEBO_&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;e0d0f020-2e7a-4551-9159-0fe8285a1822&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/musk1234.jpg?itok=TXkSEBO_&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s five things in particular investors will be looking for in this upcoming report and/or update, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-earnings-five-questions-that-need-answers-for-investors/&quot;&gt;IBD noted this weekend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investor focus is shifting to Tesla’s promised robotaxi rollout.&lt;/strong&gt; Musk has said paid rides would begin in Austin this June, but his past claims about autonomy have repeatedly fallen short. The latest FSD update shows modest progress, but it&apos;s still far from viable as a robotaxi platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cybercab—unveiled last year as a two-seater without a steering wheel—is supposed to launch before 2027 at under $30,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Reuters recently reported that Trump’s 145% tariff on Chinese goods has halted key parts shipments, possibly delaying both the Cybercab and Semi. The Cybercab’s cost-saving “unboxed” manufacturing method also remains unproven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla’s long-teased affordable EV. &lt;/strong&gt;Reports suggest the first lower-cost option may just be a simplified Model Y, possibly arriving in 2025 or 2026. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vehicle sales for Q1 fell 13% year-over-year to 336,681&lt;/strong&gt;. Growth is expected to stagnate this year, with consensus forecasting a modest 3% increase in deliveries, though some analysts now expect fewer sales than in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China sales rose slightly but remain low-margin, while U.S. and European demand has been hit by Musk’s controversial public profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;strong&gt;Tesla’s exposure to Trump’s tariffs&lt;/strong&gt; is limited compared to other automakers, it still relies on Chinese suppliers for battery components, including CATL and BYD. Investors will be watching for updates on how Tesla plans to respond to trade tensions and cost pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/musk123.jpg?itok=vEmqvhN5&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/musk123.jpg?itok=vEmqvhN5&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;e753a401-4e35-4c82-aab1-28eff517b538&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;370&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/musk123.jpg?itok=vEmqvhN5&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk’s political involvement&lt;/strong&gt; is also on watch. He has been rumored to be finishing his work with DOGE by May and people are watching for a potential full-time return to Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBD &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-earnings-five-questions-that-need-answers-for-investors/&quot;&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt; that a March YouGov/Yahoo News poll found 67% of U.S. adults wouldn’t consider a Tesla, with 37% citing Musk as the reason. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a longtime bull, cut his Tesla price target by 40%, calling the situation a “perfect storm” and estimating Tesla has lost at least 10% of its future customer base—potentially more than 20% in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demonstrations at dealerships and reports of vandalism continue. Musk is reportedly planning to leave his White House role, but no timeline has been confirmed. Investors will be listening for any update on his level of involvement moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;The UK Is Doubling Down On Wind Energy&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Wind-Power/The-UK-Is-Doubling-Down-on-Wind-Energy.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Felicity Bradstock via OilPrice.com,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UK is expanding its wind energy capacity, particularly offshore, with the approval of the Rampion 2 project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rampion 2 expansion will add 1.2 GW of capacity, enough to power around 1 million UK homes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UK government aims to quadruple its offshore wind capacity by 2030 as part of its net-zero carbon goals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K. is already a world leader in wind energy, having rapidly expanded both its onshore and offshore wind capacity over the last decade. Now, under the new Labour government, the U.K. hopes to expand its wind power sector even further through the massive expansion of the Rampion offshore wind farm. &lt;strong&gt;This is expected to help the government progress towards achieving its net-zero carbon ambitions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-18_dzaab0nuh1.jpg?itok=aQ4IUsWw&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-18_dzaab0nuh1.jpg?itok=aQ4IUsWw&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;8b5598e6-5987-43c9-9f07-c318fdf05420&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;209&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-18_dzaab0nuh1.jpg?itok=aQ4IUsWw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 2023, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.renewableuk.com/media/xyubzj4o/wind-energy-facts-and-figures-brochure-september-2024-final.pdf&quot;&gt;46.4 percent of the UK’s electricity was generated using renewable energy sources&lt;/a&gt;, of which wind energy contributed 61 percent. &lt;/strong&gt;Around 39.7 percent of the U.K.’s wind energy is generated onshore and the remaining 60.3 offshore. The U.K. constructed its first commercial onshore wind farm in 1991, generating 1 GW of wind capacity. In 2024, the U.K.’s wind energy capacity increased to 30GW, double that of 2017. The U.K. has 11,906 turbines, with 9,141 onshore and 2,765 offshore, consisting of 10 floating and 2,755 fixed turbines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approximately 32,000 people are employed in the U.K.’s offshore wind industry, a figure that is expected to increase to over 120,000 by 2030.&lt;/strong&gt; The government also hopes to achieve 60 GW of wind capacity by the end of the decade, which could add as much as $58.5 billion to the economy. By the beginning of 2025, the U.K. had grown its offshore wind energy capacity to become the largest in Europe and &lt;a href=&quot;https://maritime-executive.com/article/wind-energy-becomes-uk-s-largest-source-of-electricity-surpassing-gas#:~:text=The%20UK%27s%20offshore%20wind%20sector,growth%20in%20the%20following%20years.&quot;&gt;second only to China&lt;/a&gt;, at 14 GW. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In early April, the government approved plans to develop Rampion 2, an offshore wind farm with enough energy to power around 1 million U.K. homes. &lt;/strong&gt;The expansion of the Rampion offshore wind farm, off England’s south coast, would include the addition of 90 turbines to add 1.2 GW of capacity. The project is expected to create 4,000 jobs during the construction phase, which is scheduled to commence in 2026. The government decision on the expansion was expected to be delivered in February but it has been delayed while more information is collected from the project’s developer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind farm is being developed by RWE as the majority shareholder (50.1 percent), a Macquarie-led consortium (25 percent), and Enbridge (24.9 percent). The electricity produced at Rampion will be transported to land via subsea cables. An underground cable will then deliver the power inland to a new substation at Oakendene near Cowfold before connecting it to the national grid at Bolney in Sussex. &lt;strong&gt;The wind farm is expected to be operational by the late 2020s. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danielle Lane, the director of offshore wind development U.K. and Ireland at RWE, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.power-technology.com/news/uk-rampion-wind-farm-extension/?cf-view&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt;, “We are delighted to receive the development consent order for the proposed Rampion 2 offshore wind farm. This is a key milestone in the development of the project, as Rampion 2 can play an important role in helping secure the U.K.’s energy supplies from our abundant wind resource and play a key role in supporting the U.K. government’s clean power ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since coming into power last July, the Labour government has gone full throttle on the deployment of green energy, with plans to double the U.K.’s onshore wind, triple its solar power, and quadruple its offshore wind power capacity by 2030. It has also announced plans to reduce the contribution of natural gas to the country’s electricity generation to just 5 percent by the end of the decade. Thanks to the development of a more friendly investment environment, in an event in October some of the world’s largest green energy companies pledged to invest almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Labours-Leadership-Has-Sparked-Massive-Clean-Energy-Investments-in-the-UK.html&quot;&gt;$31.39 billion across the U.K&lt;/a&gt;., demonstrating that greater public investment in the sector is attracting higher levels of private financing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/04/offshore-windfarm-in-sussex-turbines-rampion&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The U.K. has a boundless supply of wind that cannot be turned on and off at the whims of dictators and petrostates. It’s time to get off the fossil fuel rollercoaster, roll out clean power, protect our energy security and bring down bills for good.” He added, “This project puts us within reach of our clean power offshore wind target,” Miliband said. “Through our plan for change, we’re getting on with delivering the clean energy and jobs Britain needs.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year was a record year for wind energy production, with onshore and offshore projects producing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e3g9xv3ylo&quot;&gt;83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, an increase from almost 79 TWh in 2023. In around 10 days in December alone, over 50 percent of Britain&apos;s electricity production came from wind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, there are also less windy periods, where energy production is lower. This suggests the need for greater investment in battery storage technology to make the renewable energy source more reliable and help reduce the U.K.’s reliance on fossil fuels during low-production times.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. is already a major onshore and offshore producer of wind energy, having developed several projects over the last three decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approval of the new Rampion 2 project is expected to put the country on track to achieve its end-of-decade climate goals, by decarbonising its transmission network. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is one of many clean energy projects the Labour government has announced over the last eight months, with the ambitious green transition agenda expected to attract high levels of private funding in the sector.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>The UK Is Doubling Down On Wind Energy

            
Authored by Felicity Bradstock via OilPrice.com,

	
The UK is expanding its wind energy capacity, particularly offshore, with the approval of the Rampion 2 project.
The Rampion 2 expansion will add 1.2 GW of capacity, enough to power around 1 million UK homes.
The UK government aims to quadruple its offshore wind capacity by 2030 as part of its net-zero carbon goals.

Approximately 32,000 people are employed in the U.K.’s offshore wind industry, a figure that is expected to increase to over 120,000 by 2030. The government also hopes to achieve 60 GW of wind capacity by the end of the decade, which could add as much as $58.5 billion to the economy. By the beginning of 2025, the U.K. had grown its offshore wind energy capacity to become the largest in Europe and second only to China, at 14 GW. 
In early April, the government approved plans to develop Rampion 2, an offshore wind farm with enough energy to power around 1 million U.K. homes. The expansion of the Rampion offshore wind farm, off England’s south coast, would include the addition of 90 turbines to add 1.2 GW of capacity. The project is expected to create 4,000 jobs during the construction phase, which is scheduled to commence in 2026. The government decision on the expansion was expected to be delivered in February but it has been delayed while more information is collected from the project’s developer. 
The wind farm is being developed by RWE as the majority shareholder (50.1 percent), a Macquarie-led consortium (25 percent), and Enbridge (24.9 percent). The electricity produced at Rampion will be transported to land via subsea cables. An underground cable will then deliver the power inland to a new substation at Oakendene near Cowfold before connecting it to the national grid at Bolney in Sussex. The wind farm is expected to be operational by the late 2020s. 
Danielle Lane, the director of offshore wind development U.K. and Ireland at RWE, stated, “We are delighted to receive the development consent order for the proposed Rampion 2 offshore wind farm. This is a key milestone in the development of the project, as Rampion 2 can play an important role in helping secure the U.K.’s energy supplies from our abundant wind resource and play a key role in supporting the U.K. government’s clean power ambitions.”
Since coming into power last July, the Labour government has gone full throttle on the deployment of green energy, with plans to double the U.K.’s onshore wind, triple its solar power, and quadruple its offshore wind power capacity by 2030. It has also announced plans to reduce the contribution of natural gas to the country’s electricity generation to just 5 percent by the end of the decade. Thanks to the development of a more friendly investment environment, in an event in October some of the world’s largest green energy companies pledged to invest almost $31.39 billion across the U.K., demonstrating that greater public investment in the sector is attracting higher levels of private financing. 
U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said, “The U.K. has a boundless supply of wind that cannot be turned on and off at the whims of dictators and petrostates. It’s time to get off the fossil fuel rollercoaster, roll out clean power, protect our energy security and bring down bills for good.” He added, “This project puts us within reach of our clean power offshore wind target,” Miliband said. “Through our plan for change, we’re getting on with delivering the clean energy and jobs Britain needs.”
Last year was a record year for wind energy production, with onshore and offshore projects producing 83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across Great Britain, an increase from almost 79 TWh in 2023. In around 10 days in December alone, over 50 percent of Britain&apos;s electricity production came from wind. 
However, there are also less windy periods, where energy production is lower. This suggests the need for greater investment in battery storage technology to make the renewable energy source more reliable and help reduce the U.K.’s reliance on fossil fuels during low-production times.
The U.K. is already a major onshore and offshore producer of wind energy, having developed several projects over the last three decades. 
The approval of the new Rampion 2 project is expected to put the country on track to achieve its end-of-decade climate goals, by decarbonising its transmission network. 
This is one of many clean energy projects the Labour government has announced over the last eight months, with the ambitious green transition agenda expected to attract high levels of private funding in the sector.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;China Is In Economic Dire Straits And They&apos;re No Longer Able To Hide It&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official economic data from any government is always treated with suspicion by anyone with common sense.  The US, for example, witnessed some of the most egregious statistical tinkering imaginable under the Biden Administration, not to mention outright lies and propaganda from the establishment media on the health of the economy.  To this day no one has been fired (or tarred and feathered) for hiding the reality of the stagflation crisis.  Any government or corporate economist that called the threat &quot;transitory&quot; should be stripped of their financial prestige and banished to a cash register at Arby&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let&apos;s not forget Biden&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/lost-todays-job-revision-chaos-over-1-million-foreign-born-workers-found-job-and-no&quot;&gt;misrepresentation of the labor market&lt;/a&gt;, portraying millions of new jobs for illegal migrants and visa holders as if they were jobs benefiting American citizens.  In the US and across the western world, lying about the economy is generally seen by politicians as a temporary solution to secure reelection.  However, in China, lying about the economy is treated as a national security imperative.  If there&apos;s anything in the world that gives communists a feeling of existential dread, it&apos;s the fear that their ideological enemies will discover proof that communism doesn&apos;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump Administration&apos;s tariffs on China are not the initiator of the nation&apos;s troubles, they are more a bookend to a process of decline that has been ongoing for years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/ChinaCollapse1.jpg?itok=lS6l1vUv&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ChinaCollapse1.jpg?itok=lS6l1vUv&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;e772fc85-54bc-46af-8e54-e69f5d50b72d&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ChinaCollapse1.jpg?itok=lS6l1vUv&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall tariffs on Chinese goods currently sit at 124%, but some goods will be taxed as high as 245%.  Trump has given a 1 month exemption on electronic parts and devices, perhaps to offer manufacturers like Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft time to arrange sourcing from alternative vendors.  The problem for Chinese manufacturers is not just the tariffs but the uncertainty of timing and sudden changes to policy.  They say no one is willing to make a big move on production or shipments until the trade landscape becomes more predictable.  This means most Chinese factories are frozen in stasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s tariff actions are widely criticized by the media as erratic or poorly planned, but what they don&apos;t understand is that uncertainty is the real leverage, not the tariffs.  What seems like a spur of the moment decision or a sudden capitulation on Trump&apos;s part can be highly effective at throwing foreign governments and corporations off balance.  Globalism requires a perpetual status quo, change of any kind is like holy water to a vampire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese shipments are on standby and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/16/trade-war-fallout-china-freight-ship-decline-begins-orders-plummet.html&quot;&gt;orders are frozen&lt;/a&gt;.  Nothing is moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQ9klecFbMw&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At bottom, China will not be able to survive tariffs on the current scale for long (a single year of 124% tariffs would crush China&apos;s economy beyond repair).  The US is 15% of China&apos;s export market, which may not sound substantial but their next largest trading partner (outside of Hong Kong) is Vietnam at 4% of exports.  In terms of domestic buying, China is 11% of the global consumer market which is not too shabby, but compared to the US with its 30%-35% global consumer market share there is no chance that the Chinese will be able to fill the void domestically and stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the situation is far worse than most people know...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been suffering from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-deflation-housing-congress-36d116f4657aa3064882af9b2dd57b14&quot;&gt;deflationary crisis since 2023&lt;/a&gt;.  An uptick in exports during the pandemic was offset by the CCP&apos;s draconian lockdowns.  This was, essentially, fiscal suicide on the part of the government and China has been struggling ever since.  Their property market has imploded, partially due to overbuilding through government subsidized infrastructure programs that flooded the market with poorly constructed homes and buildings that were then left to rot.  Corporate defaults have run rampant and left investors with nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some optimism that the government’s measures to end the crisis had been working to reinvigorate the market, but on Mar 31st, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/why-china-cant-sort-out-its-property-market-mess&quot;&gt;government-linked developer Vanke&lt;/a&gt; reported a record 49.5 billion yuan (S$9.1 billion) annual loss for 2024.  It’s the company’s first full-year loss since its initial public offering in 1991, reigniting concerns about the sector and showing just how deep the problem runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gVtO4FIb3vw&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these projects do finally see some progress it is often due to dangerously poor construction standards and subpar workmanship; what many now refer to as &quot;Tofu Dreg&quot; buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWOBYGC9JJI?start=26&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deflationary spiral has been eating away at employment and has also resulted in numerous factories refusing to pay their workers on time (or at all).  Unpaid wages are leading to frequent protests and a disturbing trend of factory fires.  The government is limited in how it can respond to the problem.  Stimulus is an option, but China&apos;s &lt;span data-huuid=&quot;16814439806895594041&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;overall non-financial debt is well over 300% of GDP already.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&apos;s attempts to hide the decay from the outside world are becoming less and less effective.  With Chinese citizens able to access the internet beyond the &quot;Great Firewall&quot;, more and more videos are being leaked by people within the country who are tired of the misinformation.  Again, the CCP views negative economic data as a national security threat and any citizen caught leaking this info could be subject to harsh punishment.  Chinese citizens have taken substantial risks to get the truth out there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It cannot be stressed enough that the global economy is largely a farce, but China is closest to the edge of the cliff in terms of consequences and crisis.  The interdependency of globalism has left many nations without the ability to weather a trade dispute and China&apos;s survival is almost entirely based on steady exports to the west and the US in particular. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t let high paid TikTok and YouTube influencers fool you with videos of Chinese skyscrapers caked with LED lights or lavish parties with dancing robots.  This is not the true China.  Underneath the facade is a nation on the brink of disaster.   &lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Minerals In Hand, Africa&apos;s Trade Envoys Head For The US&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/minerals-in-hand-africas-trade-envoys-head-for-the-us-5844114?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Darren Taylor via The Epoch Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mcebisi Jonas doesn’t usually suffer from nerves. If he did, he wouldn’t have survived a brutal guerrilla campaign against South Africa’s apartheid foot-soldiers in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As a cadre for the ANC [then-banned African National Congress], I was fighting for freedom from racism, for black people’s right to vote, for human rights,” &lt;/strong&gt;he told The Epoch Times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Now, I am about to fight another, very different battle. I am a bit nervous, but I am ready to talk with any and all representatives of the U.S. president, and I trust we will treat one another with respect,”&lt;/strong&gt; said Pretoria’s eloquent former minister of finance and now successful businessman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonas is part of a recently created exclusive club of special envoys appointed by most of Africa’s 54 countries to negotiate better export terms they hope will allow them to sell their goods for “reasonable profit” in the world’s most lucrative market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2890%29_5.jpg?itok=c5nEg-Mk&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2890%29_5.jpg?itok=c5nEg-Mk&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;0ff1bf45-cd19-42a8-9584-06382eac8d2f&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2890%29_5.jpg?itok=c5nEg-Mk&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s April 2 announcement of tariffs on goods exported to the United States by its economic partners. Trump has said the duties would correct trade imbalances he said are unfair to America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week later, Trump paused his reciprocal tariffs for 90 days—except for those on China—indicating that many countries had reached out and that the United States was open to negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If nothing were to change after the 90-day pause, some of the highest tariffs—between 30 and 50 percent—would be for products imported from Africa.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa’s envoys are now rushing to meet the deadline in July when the raised duties are scheduled to come into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A man melts pure gold fragments coming from different mines in the region, at a gold market in Geita, Tanzania, on May 28, 2022. Luis Tato/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Most African countries export much more to the United States than they import from the United States, so the Trump administration calculated that trade between the regions is unfairly weighted towards Africa and that the United States is losing out,”&lt;/em&gt; explained Morné Malan, deputy head of policy at South Africa’s Free Market Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Besides trade deficits, Trump also looked for other signs of trade barriers as criteria for imposing tariffs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya, with which the United States enjoyed a trade surplus, is an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the United States Trade Representative, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/africa/east-africa/kenya&quot;&gt;East Africa’s largest economy&lt;/a&gt; exported goods—mainly textiles, coffee, tea, and fruit—to the value of $737.3 million to the United States in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That year, Kenya imported goods worth $782.5 million from the United States, primarily petroleum products, aircraft and related parts, machinery, and pharmaceuticals, giving the United States a trade surplus of $45.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, President William Ruto’s government had anticipated that Trump would hit Kenya with a higher tariff, as Nairobi charges a 10 percent tax on American imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, said Trade and Industry cabinet secretary, Lee Kinyanjui, the country went into “damage control mode,” dispatching a team of negotiators to the White House a day before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Kenyan government’s main objective of securing duty-free or “very favourable duty access” for its goods into the U.S. market is still the subject of talks, Trump levied a reciprocal tariff of only 10 percent on Nairobi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We believe it helped us a lot to speak to Trump’s people ahead of his announcement, and directly afterwards,” Kinyanjui told The Epoch Times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We are considering a free trade agreement with the United States, and that will mean the scrapping of the tariff on American goods entering Kenya, and we will hopefully still export duty-free to the United States. That is reciprocity.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Gruzd of the South African Institute of International Affairs described Kenya as a “bit of an anomaly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am no fan of the African governments that steal their countries’ resources and keep their people poor, but I must also agree that it’s a bit of a stretch to expect nations with low GDPs and tiny budgets and huge debts and low manufacturing bases to import at large scale expensive goods, products and services from the wealthiest economy in the world,” he told The Epoch Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in this context that the African envoys will visit the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“He’s about to enter a lion’s den,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Malan said of Jonas, the South African diplomat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ 31 percent tariffs on South Africa—which was included in a list of 60 nations Trump said had traded with his country unfairly during his announcement on April 2—is just the president’s latest salvo against the continent’s largest, most industrialized economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country featured prominently in the series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025&quot;&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt; Trump has signed since re-entering the White House on Jan. 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of his first executive orders, the U.S. leader accused Pretoria of implementing racist laws aimed at discriminating and encouraging violence against white Afrikaners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump subsequently withdrew $440 million in annual funding to South Africa, resulting in a slowdown of the country’s HIV treatment and prevention program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He said South Africa is a threat to U.S. national security as its ANC government has military and economic alliances with some of Washington’s primary geopolitical foes, including China, Iran, and Russia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump also criticized Pretoria for launching a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/South-Africa-v-Israel.pdf&quot;&gt;case of genocide&lt;/a&gt; in the Gaza war against Israel at the International Court of Justice. The war was triggered by terrorist group Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, Secretary of State Marco Rubio expelled South Africa’s ambassador to Washington, the ANC’s Ebrahim Rasool, after the diplomat described Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement and his administration as “supremacist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonas grimaced and said, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Yes, recent history between South Africa and the United States is not good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But I am convinced we can cooperate going forward and we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement that will foster the flow of American goods into our country, and vice versa.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Gruzd of the South African Institute of International Affairs said that, in communications within the Trump administration, “it has become clear that they consider Pretoria to be the enemy, giving the [President Cyril] Ramaphosa government the same status as Beijing and Moscow and Tehran.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many in Africa, said Gruzd, Pretoria has “good cards to deal” to convince the U.S. president. Its cards are beaming the allure of the continent’s vast resources, which include precious metals like gold and platinum, and critical minerals essential to energy security and defense, as they’re major components of weapons and military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a paper analyzing Africa’s potential responses to the U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-should-africa-respond-trumps-new-tariffs&quot;&gt;tariffs&lt;/a&gt;, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington said 24 of Africa’s 54 countries are dependent on mining and minerals for income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Africa holds a third of the world’s critical minerals&lt;/strong&gt;, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/what-african-producers-of-critical-minerals-can-learn-from-indonesias-experience/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by U.S. think-tank The Atlantic Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa already supplies almost all of America’s chromium and provides a quarter of its manganese requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/manganese-statistics-and-information&quot;&gt;Manganese&lt;/a&gt; is a diverse mineral, used to produce steel and rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chromium features prominently in weapons manufacturing, including missile systems and fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other minerals produced at a large scale by African countries include lithium, used in electric car batteries, and coltan, used in communications equipment like cell phones and computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Trump has exempted critical minerals from tariffs, Gruzd said South Africa’s mineral wealth still has a role in possibly lowering the U.S. levies on South Africa, considering the Trump administration’s wish to reduce U.S. dependency on Chinese supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“China dominates Africa’s minerals sector, and it has mines all over the place, from DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo] to Zambia to Guinea,”&lt;/strong&gt; Gruzd said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beijing’s harvesting of the continent’s minerals and metals and processing them has placed the United States at an immense disadvantage in terms of making sure it has a reliable supply of these critical items well into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gruzd said if the United States and South Africa can strike a deal on critical minerals, “that would be a big win, politically and economically, for the Trump administration.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If Trump is offered mining rights in certain African countries, this would go a long way in persuading him to lower tariffs and perhaps even drop them because it would give the United States a big foothold in global supply chains,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS said that Trump should revoke tariffs on African countries and that the African Union and African leaders “should seek to demonstrate that preferential trade with the continent, in fact, overall serves U.S. national interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just like Canada and Mexico were exempt from the reciprocal tariffs due to the United States’ national interest, a similar case can be made for Africa in terms of market access and critical minerals supply chain security,” wrote economic development experts Hannah Ryder, Trevor Lwere, and Ovigwe Eguegu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As tariffs are set to hit U.S. firms in the automotive, aerospace, and chemical sectors, which are heavily dependent on critical minerals, the bulk of which Africa has, it is not in the U.S. interest to impose tariffs on African goods.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryder, Lwere, and Eguegu highlighted that one of the Trump administration’s aims is to gain greater market access for American firms and products abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This requires the existence of purchasing power amongst foreign consumers. By imposing tariffs on African exports to the United States, however, the United States makes it difficult for Africa to obtain the purchasing power necessary to demand U.S. products,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The experts said the United States should support preferential access for African goods to the American market as a market-building strategy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is critical, they wrote, especially considering that Africa has the youngest population and will be home to over 25 percent of the global population in the next few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bamidele Ayemibo, lead trade policy consultant at Nigeria’s 3T Impex Consulting Limited, said African governments’ response to Trump’s tariffs should be to sign preferential trade agreements with the United States—and with other partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The last thing they should do is retaliate with higher tariffs on U.S. products; they do not have the economic power to do so and they will only hurt themselves,” he told The Epoch Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Now, more than ever, it is time for talk and for bargaining.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Minerals In Hand, Africa&apos;s Trade Envoys Head For The US

            
Authored by Darren Taylor via The Epoch Times,
Mcebisi Jonas doesn’t usually suffer from nerves. If he did, he wouldn’t have survived a brutal guerrilla campaign against South Africa’s apartheid foot-soldiers in the 1970s and 1980s.
“As a cadre for the ANC [then-banned African National Congress], I was fighting for freedom from racism, for black people’s right to vote, for human rights,” he told The Epoch Times.
“Now, I am about to fight another, very different battle. I am a bit nervous, but I am ready to talk with any and all representatives of the U.S. president, and I trust we will treat one another with respect,” said Pretoria’s eloquent former minister of finance and now successful businessman.
Jonas is part of a recently created exclusive club of special envoys appointed by most of Africa’s 54 countries to negotiate better export terms they hope will allow them to sell their goods for “reasonable profit” in the world’s most lucrative market.



This followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s April 2 announcement of tariffs on goods exported to the United States by its economic partners. Trump has said the duties would correct trade imbalances he said are unfair to America.
A week later, Trump paused his reciprocal tariffs for 90 days—except for those on China—indicating that many countries had reached out and that the United States was open to negotiations.
If nothing were to change after the 90-day pause, some of the highest tariffs—between 30 and 50 percent—would be for products imported from Africa.
Africa’s envoys are now rushing to meet the deadline in July when the raised duties are scheduled to come into effect.

“Most African countries export much more to the United States than they import from the United States, so the Trump administration calculated that trade between the regions is unfairly weighted towards Africa and that the United States is losing out,” explained Morné Malan, deputy head of policy at South Africa’s Free Market Foundation.
Besides trade deficits, Trump also looked for other signs of trade barriers as criteria for imposing tariffs.
Kenya, with which the United States enjoyed a trade surplus, is an example.
According to the United States Trade Representative, East Africa’s largest economy exported goods—mainly textiles, coffee, tea, and fruit—to the value of $737.3 million to the United States in 2024.
That year, Kenya imported goods worth $782.5 million from the United States, primarily petroleum products, aircraft and related parts, machinery, and pharmaceuticals, giving the United States a trade surplus of $45.2 million.
Despite this, President William Ruto’s government had anticipated that Trump would hit Kenya with a higher tariff, as Nairobi charges a 10 percent tax on American imports.
So, said Trade and Industry cabinet secretary, Lee Kinyanjui, the country went into “damage control mode,” dispatching a team of negotiators to the White House a day before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement.
Although the Kenyan government’s main objective of securing duty-free or “very favourable duty access” for its goods into the U.S. market is still the subject of talks, Trump levied a reciprocal tariff of only 10 percent on Nairobi.
“We believe it helped us a lot to speak to Trump’s people ahead of his announcement, and directly afterwards,” Kinyanjui told The Epoch Times.
“We are considering a free trade agreement with the United States, and that will mean the scrapping of the tariff on American goods entering Kenya, and we will hopefully still export duty-free to the United States. That is reciprocity.”
Steven Gruzd of the South African Institute of International Affairs described Kenya as a “bit of an anomaly.”
“I am no fan of the African governments that steal their countries’ resources and keep their people poor, but I must also agree that it’s a bit of a stretch to expect nations with low GDPs and tiny budgets and huge debts and low manufacturing bases to import at large scale expensive goods, products and services from the wealthiest economy in the world,” he told The Epoch Times.
It is in this context that the African envoys will visit the White House.
“He’s about to enter a lion’s den,” Malan said of Jonas, the South African diplomat.

      <title>Defund The Cartels: A Smarter Plan For The Border</title>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Defund The Cartels: A Smarter Plan For The Border&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/opinion/defund-the-cartels-a-smarter-plan-for-the-border-5844017?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Mollie Engelhart via The Epoch Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t fit neatly into a political box, especially when it comes to immigration. I’m a wife to a man who came here illegally at 16. I’ve taken legal guardianship of an unaccompanied minor and folded him into my family. I work in both hospitality and agriculture—industries that rely heavily on immigrant labor. My views on the border don’t align with any party line, and I’m aware that people on both sides of the aisle might find something in this article to disagree with. But that doesn’t make the conversation less necessary. It makes it more urgent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;America needs labor. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s not up for debate. We’ve raised a few generations of kids who are not equipped for hard, uncomfortable work—especially those who came of age during the pandemic. I’ve had over 350 employees at any one time in my businesses, and I’ve watched the workforce shift dramatically in just 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2889%29_5.jpg?itok=1gmAsNsb&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2889%29_5.jpg?itok=1gmAsNsb&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ca1514a5-86d5-4ea5-b2a9-a0ca8f381f88&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2889%29_5.jpg?itok=1gmAsNsb&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the same time, I believe a border wall is not racist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wall, like a fence or a locked front door, doesn’t carry moral weight. Strong borders make good neighbors. But let’s be honest: the southern border is already secured—just not by us. It’s secured by the Mexican cartels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every person crossing is paying $10,000 to $13,000 to make that journey—not including the pre-planned robbery that happens to nearly every person along the way, and sometimes additional financial extortion afterward. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not just turning a blind eye to this—we’re funding it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our labor shortage—our need for labor—is creating a massive revenue source for the cartels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many commentators scream, “Come legally!”—but the reality is, there are almost no viable legal pathways for Mexicans to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlike people from other countries, Mexicans cannot easily claim asylum. &lt;/strong&gt;Citizens of many Central and South American nations can claim asylum and stay in the United States while they await trial—a process that often takes five to 10 years. Even if their claim is denied, most never leave. Mexicans do not have this option. We are effectively prioritizing other nations over our immediate neighbor, and it makes no sense. We should be prioritizing Mexico first, and then Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humanitarian crisis is not what the media portrays. &lt;strong&gt;The real crisis is what happens before these people arrive - the women and children abused, trafficked, and disappeared in cartel territory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the man who hasn’t seen his mother in 20 years, or the woman who has children on both sides of the border and cannot return to see her children or grandchildren. She may never see her children here again. These are real stories. I live with them in my family and in my community. My husband didn’t see his mother for 12 years prior to marrying me and becoming an American citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, America is a melting pot. Yes, we welcome the tired and the poor. But no, we cannot take everyone. It’s not sustainable. And pretending otherwise only perpetuates suffering.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s create a 10-year low-skill work visa. It would cost $10,000 - money that currently goes to cartels. Workers would be permitted to come and go, visit family, and live with dignity. Employment would be mandatory; workers could not remain unemployed longer than three months. Applicants must have no criminal history. This visa would never lead to citizenship, even through marriage. The best case would be a green card, but not a vote. Workers would pay taxes and contribute $10 per paycheck to Social Security, which they would never draw from. After 10 years, the visa could be renewed once—or the worker could return home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We would prioritize Mexico, and then Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras—because a strong neighbor is national security. If your neighbor’s house is burning down, your own home is at risk.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong, thriving Mexico makes for a safer America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A healthy economy and stable society in the countries closest to us reduces pressure on our border and increases mutual prosperity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plan would dismantle the cartels’ business model, reunite families, end the incentive to bring children as props for border entry, and redirect billions of dollars from crime syndicates to the U.S. government. Migrants could fly directly into cities where jobs await—no more treacherous desert crossings or predatory smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One side of the aisle screams that we don’t want them—but still enjoys the literal fruits of their labor. The other side screams “humanitarian crisis” and “racism”—but takes no meaningful action, even when in power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, I believe there’s a solution that supports integrity for our border, for our businesses, for our families, and for our neighbors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But both sides of the aisle have not been interested in real solutions for a long time—and that begs the question: why? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the benefit of the gray? What is the benefit of a system that is clearly broken and leads to drugs, rape, murder, and chaos?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t fit neatly into a political box, especially when it comes to immigration. I’m a wife to a man who came here illegally at 16. I’ve taken legal guardianship of an unaccompanied minor and folded him into my family. I work in both hospitality and agriculture—industries that rely heavily on immigrant labor. My views on the border don’t align with any party line, and I’m aware that people on both sides of the aisle might find something in this article to disagree with. But that doesn’t make the conversation less necessary. It makes it more urgent.
America needs labor. That’s not up for debate. We’ve raised a few generations of kids who are not equipped for hard, uncomfortable work—especially those who came of age during the pandemic. I’ve had over 350 employees at any one time in my businesses, and I’ve watched the workforce shift dramatically in just 10 years.



At the same time, I believe a border wall is not racist.
A wall, like a fence or a locked front door, doesn’t carry moral weight. Strong borders make good neighbors. But let’s be honest: the southern border is already secured—just not by us. It’s secured by the Mexican cartels. 
Every person crossing is paying $10,000 to $13,000 to make that journey—not including the pre-planned robbery that happens to nearly every person along the way, and sometimes additional financial extortion afterward. 
We’re not just turning a blind eye to this—we’re funding it. 
Our labor shortage—our need for labor—is creating a massive revenue source for the cartels.
Many commentators scream, “Come legally!”—but the reality is, there are almost no viable legal pathways for Mexicans to do so.
Unlike people from other countries, Mexicans cannot easily claim asylum. Citizens of many Central and South American nations can claim asylum and stay in the United States while they await trial—a process that often takes five to 10 years. Even if their claim is denied, most never leave. Mexicans do not have this option. We are effectively prioritizing other nations over our immediate neighbor, and it makes no sense. We should be prioritizing Mexico first, and then Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.
The humanitarian crisis is not what the media portrays. The real crisis is what happens before these people arrive - the women and children abused, trafficked, and disappeared in cartel territory.
It’s the man who hasn’t seen his mother in 20 years, or the woman who has children on both sides of the border and cannot return to see her children or grandchildren. She may never see her children here again. These are real stories. I live with them in my family and in my community. My husband didn’t see his mother for 12 years prior to marrying me and becoming an American citizen.
Yes, America is a melting pot. Yes, we welcome the tired and the poor. But no, we cannot take everyone. It’s not sustainable. And pretending otherwise only perpetuates suffering.
Let’s create a 10-year low-skill work visa. It would cost $10,000 - money that currently goes to cartels. Workers would be permitted to come and go, visit family, and live with dignity. Employment would be mandatory; workers could not remain unemployed longer than three months. Applicants must have no criminal history. This visa would never lead to citizenship, even through marriage. The best case would be a green card, but not a vote. Workers would pay taxes and contribute $10 per paycheck to Social Security, which they would never draw from. After 10 years, the visa could be renewed once—or the worker could return home.
We would prioritize Mexico, and then Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras—because a strong neighbor is national security. If your neighbor’s house is burning down, your own home is at risk. 
A strong, thriving Mexico makes for a safer America. 
A healthy economy and stable society in the countries closest to us reduces pressure on our border and increases mutual prosperity.
This plan would dismantle the cartels’ business model, reunite families, end the incentive to bring children as props for border entry, and redirect billions of dollars from crime syndicates to the U.S. government. Migrants could fly directly into cities where jobs await—no more treacherous desert crossings or predatory smugglers.
One side of the aisle screams that we don’t want them—but still enjoys the literal fruits of their labor. The other side screams “humanitarian crisis” and “racism”—but takes no meaningful action, even when in power.
In closing, I believe there’s a solution that supports integrity for our border, for our businesses, for our families, and for our neighbors. 
But both sides of the aisle have not been interested in real solutions for a long time—and that begs the question: why? 
What is the benefit of the gray? What is the benefit of a system that is clearly broken and leads to drugs, rape, murder, and chaos?

&lt;p&gt;This marked the &lt;strong&gt;14th consecutive year of population decline in the country, &lt;/strong&gt;according to a government estimate. The previous record drop was 861,000, reported in July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the largest demographic drop since 1968.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more details: according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, &lt;strong&gt;Japan’s total population was 123,802,000, &lt;/strong&gt;as of October 1, 2024, down by 550,000 or a 0.44% year-on-year decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/overall%20population.png?itok=dGhMXDR6&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/overall%20population.png?itok=dGhMXDR6&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;1e25e8b2-a3b1-485f-ae9a-dfd1c946e33b&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/overall%20population.png?itok=dGhMXDR6&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The population of only Japanese citizens was 120,296,000, plunging by 898,000, or a 0.74% YoY drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IMF projects that the total population will shrink by a further 3.5 million by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/japan%20population%20decline.jpg?itok=qVvnyreF&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/japan%20population%20decline.jpg?itok=qVvnyreF&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;0c20d27c-5846-479e-9967-0110ff15632a&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/japan%20population%20decline.jpg?itok=qVvnyreF&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural population decline, calculated by subtracting births from deaths, reached a record high of 890,000, rising for the eighteenth year running. This decline was 437,000 for women and 453,000 for men. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The silver lining: for the third straight year, there was a net increase in immigration, with 340,000 more people entering than leaving Japan. Which is good news for globalists: if they are so worried where to put all those African and Middle Eastern refugees who have swept across Europe sparking unprecedented blowback against establishment politics, there is always Japan... assuming the locals accept the flood of foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data underscore the country&apos;s unprecedented demographic crisis amid a rapidly aging society and collapsing birthrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan&apos;s total fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime -- fell to its lowest level in 2023 since records began in 1947, while the death/birth ratio at over 2.2, is the highest on record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures, released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, show that &lt;strong&gt;only Tokyo and neighboring Saitama prefecture registered population increases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By age group, the working population, consisting of people aged 15 to 64, stood at 73,728,000, a year-on-year decrease of 224,000, while the population aged 65 or older (red and orange in the figure below) increased by 17,000 to 36,243,000. Those 75 or older (red) increased by 700,000, to 20,777,000, and this age bracket now accounts for 57.3% of those aged 65 or older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the demographic crisis, the Japanese parliament passed a law in June 2024 aimed at reversing the falling birthrate. Measures under the law include expanded child allowances and enhanced parental leave benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.virginia.edu/content/tokyo-offering-workers-four-day-workweeks-increase-population&quot;&gt;beginning this month,&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;city government of Tokyo started offering its employees a four-day workweek, &lt;/strong&gt;hoping to increase the population and create a healthier work-life balance in a country notorious for long hours at the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials have warned that the period leading up to 2030 represents a critical window to address the trend. Late marriages, financial insecurity, and limited support for working parents are commonly cited as contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Japan Posts Record Population Drop, Shrinking For 14th Year, As Demographic Crisis Deepens

            
Japan&apos;s already collapsing population just posted its biggest annual drop on record, falling by 898,000 people as of last October compared to a year earlier, Kyodo News reported.
This marked the 14th consecutive year of population decline in the country, according to a government estimate. The previous record drop was 861,000, reported in July 2024.
This was the largest demographic drop since 1968.
Some more details: according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan’s total population was 123,802,000, as of October 1, 2024, down by 550,000 or a 0.44% year-on-year decrease.



The population of only Japanese citizens was 120,296,000, plunging by 898,000, or a 0.74% YoY drop.
The IMF projects that the total population will shrink by a further 3.5 million by the end of the decade.



The natural population decline, calculated by subtracting births from deaths, reached a record high of 890,000, rising for the eighteenth year running. This decline was 437,000 for women and 453,000 for men. 
The silver lining: for the third straight year, there was a net increase in immigration, with 340,000 more people entering than leaving Japan. Which is good news for globalists: if they are so worried where to put all those African and Middle Eastern refugees who have swept across Europe sparking unprecedented blowback against establishment politics, there is always Japan... assuming the locals accept the flood of foreigners.
The data underscore the country&apos;s unprecedented demographic crisis amid a rapidly aging society and collapsing birthrate.
Japan&apos;s total fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime -- fell to its lowest level in 2023 since records began in 1947, while the death/birth ratio at over 2.2, is the highest on record.

In response to the demographic crisis, the Japanese parliament passed a law in June 2024 aimed at reversing the falling birthrate. Measures under the law include expanded child allowances and enhanced parental leave benefits.
And beginning this month, the city government of Tokyo started offering its employees a four-day workweek, hoping to increase the population and create a healthier work-life balance in a country notorious for long hours at the office.
Officials have warned that the period leading up to 2030 represents a critical window to address the trend. Late marriages, financial insecurity, and limited support for working parents are commonly cited as contributing factors.

&lt;p&gt;But how much do Americans collectively spend on the goods and services they need? And what items draw the largest share? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Americans Spend Their Money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America’s consumer class spent nearly $19 trillion on goods and services in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, this was about 68% of the U.S. GDP that year. It was also larger than China’s overall GDP that year as well ($17.8T).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_10-50-49.jpg?itok=uIIGe8_G&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_10-50-49.jpg?itok=uIIGe8_G&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;67ab741d-82e8-4775-8b9b-97cdb5cb351d&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;379&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-20_10-50-49.jpg?itok=uIIGe8_G&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Housing and utilities&lt;/strong&gt; ($3.3T) and &lt;strong&gt;health care&lt;/strong&gt; ($3.1T) were the top household expenditure categories overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Americans spent the most money on groceries ($1.4T) in the goods category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case these numbers seem too big to comprehend, we’ve also broken down household expenditure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualcapitalist.com/how-americans-spend-their-money/&quot;&gt;by year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualcapitalist.com/average-u-s-household-budget-in-one-chart/&quot;&gt;by month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparative figures may vary as insurance expenditure can sometimes be included within a broader category (housing, transportation), or spun-off on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, another graphic from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualcapitalist.com/75-years-how-americans-spend-their-money/&quot;&gt;eight years ago&lt;/a&gt; provides some other useful insights: how the share of each category’s expenditure has changed since the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the data isn’t as recent, other trends are visible: health care and housing expenditure have been trending up, clothing and food have been coming down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Pros and Cons of the Service Economy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tellingly, services account for nearly 70% of America’s personal consumption expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is matched by the supply side as well: nearly 80% of America’s jobs are in the service sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America’s transition away from manufacturing into services—both as producer and consumer—is a story with many episodes and arcs. While it has driven the growth of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualcapitalist.com/big-tech-companies-billions/&quot;&gt;high-value technology&lt;/a&gt; and financial companies, it has also resulted in the loss of blue-collar jobs in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This context is particularly relevant in the Trump administration’s second-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broad-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/trump-administration-tariffs-lawsuit&quot;&gt;tariffs on imported goods&lt;/a&gt; have been declared to reduce trade deficits and to incentivize companies to move their manufacturing back into the country. However, modern manufacturing is built off global supply chains and just-in-time shipping, and economists worry that the disruption will only raise prices for Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Visualizing America&apos;s $19 Trillion Consumer Economy In One Chart

            
To no one’s surprise, the world’s largest economy is also the world’s largest consumer economy.
But how much do Americans collectively spend on the goods and services they need? And what items draw the largest share? 
Visual Capitalist&apos;s Pallavi Rao visualizes data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for further analysis.



Where Americans Spend Their Money
America’s consumer class spent nearly $19 trillion on goods and services in 2023.
For context, this was about 68% of the U.S. GDP that year. It was also larger than China’s overall GDP that year as well ($17.8T).



Housing and utilities ($3.3T) and health care ($3.1T) were the top household expenditure categories overall.
Meanwhile, Americans spent the most money on groceries ($1.4T) in the goods category.
In case these numbers seem too big to comprehend, we’ve also broken down household expenditure by year and by month.
Comparative figures may vary as insurance expenditure can sometimes be included within a broader category (housing, transportation), or spun-off on its own.
In a similar vein, another graphic from eight years ago provides some other useful insights: how the share of each category’s expenditure has changed since the 1940s.
While the data isn’t as recent, other trends are visible: health care and housing expenditure have been trending up, clothing and food have been coming down.
The Pros and Cons of the Service Economy
Tellingly, services account for nearly 70% of America’s personal consumption expenditure.
This is matched by the supply side as well: nearly 80% of America’s jobs are in the service sector.
America’s transition away from manufacturing into services—both as producer and consumer—is a story with many episodes and arcs. While it has driven the growth of high-value technology and financial companies, it has also resulted in the loss of blue-collar jobs in America.
This context is particularly relevant in the Trump administration’s second-term.
Broad-based tariffs on imported goods have been declared to reduce trade deficits and to incentivize companies to move their manufacturing back into the country. However, modern manufacturing is built off global supply chains and just-in-time shipping, and economists worry that the disruption will only raise prices for Americans.

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most detrimental consequences of the stagflationary surge in the US since 2020 was the meteoric rise in housing prices, from rentals to purchases to mortgages, across all markets.  At present the cost of housing stands at around 30% of the average American&apos;s income, with home prices and rentals seeing at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS&quot;&gt;a 60% increase&lt;/a&gt; in only 5 years.  In high traffic markets the prices have jumped far higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation in fixed expenses like housing, utilities, gasoline, food, etc. directly reduce disposable income which forces consumers to cut back on retail and recreational purchases.  Higher prices in retail goods can be weathered through savings and spending adaptation, higher prices in fixed expenses is much more difficult to deal with and the results are hard to miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may, however, be a light at the end of the tunnel with new developments suggesting a decline in housing costs is on the way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/total-housing-inventory&quot;&gt;US Existing Home Inventory&lt;/a&gt; is back on the rise after hitting rock bottom in 2022, with a considerable jump occurring in the year (February numbers indicate a 17% jump since 2024).  This is partially because incredibly high prices driving down purchases, but recent events indicate that the inventory trend is going to accelerate in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/UShousing1.jpeg?itok=7BAdC5AZ&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/UShousing1.jpeg?itok=7BAdC5AZ&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;c4381e61-48b6-4230-84ab-4cca6b90e8bf&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/UShousing1.jpeg?itok=7BAdC5AZ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Buyers Exiting The US Market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first actions of the Biden Administration in the face of the housing crisis should have been to enact a moratorium on foreign purchases of US properties.  This didn&apos;t happen, of course, but the tides may be shifting in favor of US buyers in the near term/ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian real estate investors and &quot;Snow Birds&quot; using secondary properties in the US as vacation homes are now reportedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/30/business/canada-snowbirds-trump-trade-war-tariffs/index.html&quot;&gt;selling off their holdings&lt;/a&gt; in light of the Trump Administration&apos;s tariff blitz.  America&apos;s socialist neighbors to the north are apparently cashing out at record pace.  Oddly, Canadian property owners say they&apos;re &quot;afraid of anti-Canadian sentiment&quot; in the US as the reason for dumping their second homes.  The US and foreign media have these people terrified that there&apos;s a wave of &quot;Canadian hate&quot; rolling through the American heartland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t happening, but on the bright side this frees up a considerable number of homes for the US market and will ultimately help to lower prices.  Canadians are the largest foreign property buyers, taking up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/canadians-sell-us-vacation-homes-propertie-3c3676e8&quot;&gt;at least 13%&lt;/a&gt; of all home purchases in the US in 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not just Canadians exiting, though. Chinese and European buyers are backing off with some states moving to block property purchases by foreign interests and hysteria over America-first nationalism frightening prospective investors.  Ultimately, this is a net positive for Americans desperate for some relief in a home market that the vast majority of citizens cannot afford.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deportations And Falling Rental Prices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be true that most illegal aliens don&apos;t buy houses, but they certainly take a massive bite out of available rentals.  With an estimate 17 million to 20 million illegals in the US at the time Joe Biden left the White House and a shortage of at least 11 million houses as of 2024, the obvious solution would be to kick out as many migrants as possible to free up the rental market.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may have already begun.  Trump border restrictions and changes to immigration policy have been wildly successful in cutting illegal border crossing.  In March, Border Patrol reported a 95% drop in encounters on the southern border, an epic decline from the Biden Administration.  ICE also reports that they have deported &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2025/03/31/us-news/ice-arrested-113k-deported-over-100k-since-trumps-return-as-prez-maintains-promise-to-boot-illegal-migrants-alleged-gangbangers-sources/&quot;&gt;at least 100,000&lt;/a&gt; and arrested 13,000 others since Trump took office.  Some skeptics might argue that this is nowhere near enough, but it does not account for the millions of migrants that are self deporting.       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least 900,000 migrants that entered the US under Biden&apos;s CBP One App have been ordered to self deport are or be arrested in the coming months.  US rental prices have been cooling for the past year, but much too slowly.  The drop in housing demand by illegals is expected to create a larger availability pool by the end of 2025, though some leftist media outlets assert that the loss of illegals will cause a decline in home construction and hurt the market instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airbnb Bonanza Fizzles And Opens The Market To 2 million Homes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Airbnb craze has been dying for at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/airbnb-revenue-collapse-housing-market-crash-fears-1809543&quot;&gt;the past two years&lt;/a&gt;.  High property taxes, declining revenues, skyrocketing insurance rates and a drop in tourism means the potential for profits is getting slimmer by the month.  With over 2.4 million homes listed as Airbnb rentals in the US right now, there&apos;s a good chance these properties will end up for sale or as long term rentals by the end of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall trend is deflationary, which is likely to scare a lot of people, but without this is necessary for any return to affordability in housing. Supply must increase in order to offset demand. Unless there are some dramatic changes soon, millions of Americans may be priced out of a home entirely. &lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Bush-Era Swamp Creature Revealed To Be Key Figure In OKC Bombing Coverup&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As I have always said:  The only difference between the KGB and the FBI is that the KGB has never claimed to be a legitimate law enforcement agency.” ~ Jesse Trentadue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers may know the name John Ashcroft, attorney general under George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/john-ashcroft-3_0.jpg?itok=wPxagTnG&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/john-ashcroft-3_0.jpg?itok=wPxagTnG&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;8e11f699-fa6f-4fe1-b056-7033ac5a1824&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/john-ashcroft-3_0.jpg?itok=wPxagTnG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, good old&lt;strong&gt; Ashcroft was at the heart of a high profile cover-up: the Oklahoma City bombing&lt;/strong&gt;, according to attorney Jesse Trentadue.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The following comes from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kennethtrentadue.com/pdf/info1.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;court filing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provided to ZeroHedge by Trentadue, attorney to OKC bombing accomplice Terry Nichols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context (per Jesse from &lt;a href=&quot;http://kennethtrentadue.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;kennethtrentadue.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;em&gt;Jesse is the brother of Kenneth Michael Trentadue who died in August 1995, while incarcerated at the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Following the death, the Department of Justice (DOJ) immediately deemed it a suicide, denied the medical examiner access to the cell where Kenneth Trentadue was killed, ordered the cell cleaned and painted, and repeatedly asked both the medical examiner and Kenneth Trentadue’s family to authorize the cremation of his body. The medical examiner could not legally authorize cremation and the family refused, demanding that Kenneth&apos;s body be returned to them. When Trentadue&apos;s body was returned to the family, they removed heavy makeup and discovered bruises all over his body, from head to foot. The bruises, cuts, and other wounds depicted an obvious beating and murder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the story…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While serving his prison sentence, Nichols attempted to spark an investigation into FBI involvement in the OKC bombing. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://kennethtrentadue.com/pdf/letter1.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;sent a letter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stating that he could provide such information to the then head of the DOJ Ashcroft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashcroft did not respond to the letter but immediately forbade the media from speaking to Nichols, which resulted in 60 Minutes cancelling a sit-down interview they had scheduled with Nichols, says Trentadue. &lt;/strong&gt;Shortly thereafter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kennethtrentadue.com/pdf/info2.pdf&quot;&gt;Nichols said&lt;/a&gt; he received a visit from a man presenting an offer from the DOJ to undo Nichols’ death sentence if he agreed to three conditions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take ownership of an anonymous warning the DOJ received saying the Murrah Building was bombed 30 minutes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it actually had been.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Implicate Nichols’ own brother in the bombing plot.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reveal the location of the “Kinestick”, an explosive used in the bombing. Nichols mentioned having knowledge of an unused stache in his letter to Ashcroft. The existence of a remaining stache was&lt;strong&gt; not known at the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existence of the mysterious call was independently corroborated in Stephen Jones’ book &lt;i&gt;Others Unknown&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and even covered by ABC News: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;ABC News 20/20 reports on how someone called the Executive Secretariat in DC about a half hour before the OKC bombing and said &quot;the Murrah building has just been bombed&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/XzMTFiCG6r&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/XzMTFiCG6r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Richard ✞ (@okc_facts) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/okc_facts/status/1913635437945737222?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 19, 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was discovered that the DOJ proxy (Michael Selby) who visited Nichols &lt;strong&gt;previously worked in Ashcroft’s private security detail. &lt;/strong&gt;Trentadue helped to further corroborate that this meeting took place by telling ZH:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the declaration was filed, Selby called me upset as hell.  &lt;strong&gt;Said that I had just got him “fucking killed.” &lt;/strong&gt; The attorney who brought Selby into meet Nichols is Rodney Uphoff.  A law professor at the University of Missouri.  I called Uphoff and he confirmed the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is strange that such an offer – giving leniency to an accomplice to one of the most horrific domestic terrorist attacks in U.S. history – would be presented by someone who does not work at the DOJ and &lt;strong&gt;stipulate that Nichol take credit for an anonymous tip which he did not make. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nichols ultimately did not accept the deal because he did not want to throw his brother under the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story, now part of official record thanks to Trentadue, serves as an interesting look into the true conspiracies that Ashcroft may have had a hand in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see the full spectrum of official documents that Jesse Trentadue has fought hard to force the government to release, follow his website named in honor of his brother who he believes was murdered by the FBI: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kennethtrentdue.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;http://www.kennethtrentadue.com/&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Bush-Era Swamp Creature Revealed To Be Key Figure In OKC Bombing Coverup

            
“As I have always said:  The only difference between the KGB and the FBI is that the KGB has never claimed to be a legitimate law enforcement agency.” ~ Jesse Trentadue
Readers may know the name John Ashcroft, attorney general under George W. Bush.



Well, good old Ashcroft was at the heart of a high profile cover-up: the Oklahoma City bombing, according to attorney Jesse Trentadue. The following comes from a court filing provided to ZeroHedge by Trentadue, attorney to OKC bombing accomplice Terry Nichols.
For context (per Jesse from kennethtrentadue.com): Jesse is the brother of Kenneth Michael Trentadue who died in August 1995, while incarcerated at the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Following the death, the Department of Justice (DOJ) immediately deemed it a suicide, denied the medical examiner access to the cell where Kenneth Trentadue was killed, ordered the cell cleaned and painted, and repeatedly asked both the medical examiner and Kenneth Trentadue’s family to authorize the cremation of his body. The medical examiner could not legally authorize cremation and the family refused, demanding that Kenneth&apos;s body be returned to them. When Trentadue&apos;s body was returned to the family, they removed heavy makeup and discovered bruises all over his body, from head to foot. The bruises, cuts, and other wounds depicted an obvious beating and murder.
Now for the story…
While serving his prison sentence, Nichols attempted to spark an investigation into FBI involvement in the OKC bombing. He sent a letter stating that he could provide such information to the then head of the DOJ Ashcroft.
Ashcroft did not respond to the letter but immediately forbade the media from speaking to Nichols, which resulted in 60 Minutes cancelling a sit-down interview they had scheduled with Nichols, says Trentadue. Shortly thereafter, Nichols said he received a visit from a man presenting an offer from the DOJ to undo Nichols’ death sentence if he agreed to three conditions:
Take ownership of an anonymous warning the DOJ received saying the Murrah Building was bombed 30 minutes before it actually had been.
Implicate Nichols’ own brother in the bombing plot.
Reveal the location of the “Kinestick”, an explosive used in the bombing. Nichols mentioned having knowledge of an unused stache in his letter to Ashcroft. The existence of a remaining stache was not known at the time.
The existence of the mysterious call was independently corroborated in Stephen Jones’ book Others Unknown and even covered by ABC News:

April 19, 2025

It was discovered that the DOJ proxy (Michael Selby) who visited Nichols previously worked in Ashcroft’s private security detail. Trentadue helped to further corroborate that this meeting took place by telling ZH:
After the declaration was filed, Selby called me upset as hell.  Said that I had just got him “fucking killed.”  The attorney who brought Selby into meet Nichols is Rodney Uphoff.  A law professor at the University of Missouri.  I called Uphoff and he confirmed the event.
It is strange that such an offer – giving leniency to an accomplice to one of the most horrific domestic terrorist attacks in U.S. history – would be presented by someone who does not work at the DOJ and stipulate that Nichol take credit for an anonymous tip which he did not make. 
Nichols ultimately did not accept the deal because he did not want to throw his brother under the bus.
The story, now part of official record thanks to Trentadue, serves as an interesting look into the true conspiracies that Ashcroft may have had a hand in.
To see the full spectrum of official documents that Jesse Trentadue has fought hard to force the government to release, follow his website named in honor of his brother who he believes was murdered by the FBI: http://www.kennethtrentadue.com/
And for a great interview where Trentadue discusses the contents of this article and more, listen to friend-of-ZeroHedge Scott Horton interview Jesse just last month.
As for Ashcroft, after &apos;retiring&apos; he started a private lobbying firm that quickly secured the Israeli government as its first client.

&lt;p&gt;Four American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) affiliates filed a lawsuit on April 18 asking a federal court to reinstate the legal status of international students who have had their visas revoked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2888%29_5.jpg?itok=OypBxtmn&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2888%29_5.jpg?itok=OypBxtmn&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;9abcef4c-6926-463b-96d8-4d9ac0a92c4a&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2888%29_5.jpg?itok=OypBxtmn&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple ACLU affiliates and the law firm Shaheen &amp; Gordon filed a federal class action &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riaclu.org/en/cases/pasula-v-department-homeland-security&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; representing more than 100 foreign students in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, and Puerto Rico who &lt;strong&gt;they say had their F-1 student immigration status “unlawfully and abruptly terminated with no specified reason as to why.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students include several at Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design, who had their student status revoked in recent weeks. The lawsuit asks the court to reinstate their F-1 student status, which would allow them to continue their studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“International students are a vital community in our state’s universities, and no administration should be allowed to circumvent the law to unilaterally strip students of status, disrupt their studies, and put them at risk of deportation,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Gilles Bissonnette, legal director of the ACLU of New Hampshire, said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riaclu.org/en/news/aclu-files-class-action-lawsuit-challenging-terminated-student-status-students-new-hampshire&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several students have already sued, arguing they were denied due process. In New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Montana, federal judges have granted temporary restraining orders to shield the students from deportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the April 18 lawsuit, which was filed in New Hampshire federal court, the affected students said they were not notified before their F-1 student statuses were canceled, opening them up to deportation and preventing them from finishing their studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complaint states that one of the students, Manikanta Pasula of India, was close to finishing his master’s in computer science at New Hampshire’s Rivier University and was working to apply for an international student work program that would allow him to stay in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another student, Hangrui Zhang of China, was in a Ph.D. program in electronic and computer science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, and says he now can no longer work as a research assistant, his only income source, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lawyers representing the students said the government did not give the required advance notice, informing the foreign students that their legal status would be terminated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 27, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department may have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/rubio-says-us-may-have-revoked-more-than-300-visas-5832536&quot;&gt;revoked&lt;/a&gt; more than 300 visas so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Rubio said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He said the reason is ”because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we’re not going to give you a visa.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rubio said he is canceling visas for those who were acting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/ice-arrests-palestinian-green-card-holder-who-led-columbia-university-protest-5822800&quot;&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt; to national interests, such as those who had protested Israel and its military action in Gaza or others facing criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One high-profile case included former Columbia University graduate student and activist Mahmoud Khalil, who was slated for deportation after leading several pro-Palestinian protests on campus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inflation Risk Is Subsiding Rapidly</title>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Inflation Risk Is Subsiding Rapidly&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/inflation-risk-is-subsiding-rapidly/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation risk has been a significant topic of discussion in the mainstream media for the last few years. Such is unsurprising given that inflation spiked following the pandemic in 2020 as consumer spending &lt;em&gt;(demand)&lt;/em&gt; was shot into overdrive from stimulus payments and production &lt;em&gt;(supply)&lt;/em&gt; was shuttered. To understand why that occurred, we need to revisit &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/do-money-supply-deficit-and-qe-create-inflation/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Economics 101.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In economics, &lt;strong&gt;inflation&lt;/strong&gt; is a general increase in the prices of goods and services. Changes in inflation are a function of fluctuations in actual demand for goods and services (also known as demand shocks, including changes in fiscal or monetary policy or recession), changes in available supplies such as during energy crises (also known as supply shocks), or changes in inflation expectations, which may be self-fulfilling. Note that supply and demand are key facets of the inflation equation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic economics states prices will be set at a level where the supply of goods or services meets consumer demand.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Supply-Demand-Chart-070522_2.jpg?itok=2GdiP8y0&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Supply-Demand-Chart-070522_2.jpg?itok=2GdiP8y0&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;9d6286a7-74f6-436d-b87a-f221d67046e9&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;331&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Supply-Demand-Chart-070522_2.jpg?itok=2GdiP8y0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic illustration shows this basic principle taught in every &lt;em&gt;“Econ 101”&lt;/em&gt; class. &lt;strong&gt;As noted, in 2020, inflation was the consequence of restricting supply and massively increasing demand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That massive surge in stimulus sent directly to households resulted in an unprecedented spike in &lt;em&gt;“savings,&lt;/em&gt;” creating artificial demand. As shown, the &lt;em&gt;“pig in the python”&lt;/em&gt; effect is evident. Over the next two years, that &lt;em&gt;“bulge”&lt;/em&gt; of excess liquidity has reverted to the previous growth trend. Given that economic growth lags behind the reversion in savings by about 12 months, we should continue to see economic growth slow into 2025. Notably, the &lt;em&gt;“lag effect”&lt;/em&gt; is critical to the &lt;em&gt;“inflation risk”&lt;/em&gt; thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-116-1024x625.jpg?itok=hOzn9Rn9&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-116-1024x625.jpg?itok=hOzn9Rn9&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;995cf8ed-9da2-4f45-a28c-d4b697cedd82&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;305&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-116-1024x625.jpg?itok=hOzn9Rn9&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding that inflation is solely a function of supply and demand, the ongoing reversal of monetary liquidity is continuing to erode economic activity. Notably, what caused the inflation spike post-2020 was not an increase in the debt or the Federal Reserve but rather the temporary increase in the money supply caused by sending checks to households. &lt;strong&gt;Therefore, the inflation risk will continue to subside unless the government passes a new infrastructure spending bill of massive proportions or sends another stimulus to households.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But Lance, tariffs are inflationary.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They aren’t for two reasons, and it all starts with consumer confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-consumer-is-the-key-to-inflation-risk&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumer Is The Key To Inflation Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand the basic assumption that if you impose a tax on a product, good, or service, then the &lt;em&gt;“cost”&lt;/em&gt; of that product, good, or service will increase, hence the inflation risk. While that is perfectly logical, it excludes two crucial factors: &lt;em&gt;1) Only producers pay the “tax” from tariffs, and 2) we measure inflation (in terms of CPI) from the consumer side of the equation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/the-tariff-risk-isnt-in-inflation-part-ii/&quot;&gt;“Tariffs Aren’t An Inflation Risk,”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; we discussed tariffs’ impact on the production side of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Post-pandemic demand surges, supply chain disruptions, and massive fiscal and monetary interventions supported those elevated margins. As evidenced by the chart below, the correlation between economic growth rates and corporate profits is high. Note that outliers of the correlation are historically related to events such as the “Financial Crisis” and post-recession economic recoveries.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-2-1024x612_0.jpg?itok=cpqTNDzl&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-2-1024x612_0.jpg?itok=cpqTNDzl&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;56c29f39-bb26-482e-ba6a-eb2983d0b444&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-2-1024x612_0.jpg?itok=cpqTNDzl&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corporations react to cost increases in their business (i.e., wages, benefits, commodities, utilities, etc.), which must be factored into the selling price to maintain profitability. &lt;strong&gt;Crucially, corporations can only pass on higher input costs to consumers if demand remains higher than the available supply of those goods or services.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2020 and 2021, corporations could pass on most of the inflationary increase to consumers as they were willing to spend the Government’s money. However, as excess savings run out, inflation declines as consumers decrease spending; corporate profits weaken as the ability to pass on higher input costs to customers fades. As shown, as inflation declines, the rate of change in corporate profits also weakens.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read that bolded sentence again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When discussing inflation risk, consumer activity drives inflationary pulses in the economy. If we use a two-year average of corporate profits minus inflation, we can visualize that impact. As shown, inflationary increases, like tariffs, are only inflationary in the economy if they can be passed onto the consumer. Inflation surged in 2020 as corporations could pass on the bulk of the cost increases to consumers flush with cash. Today, to consumers. Today, inflation is declining due to declining demand. As such, the percentage of cost increases corporations must absorb is increasing, which reduces corporate profitability but shows up in the economy as slowing inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-117-1024x649.jpg?itok=fR5qCBSL&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-117-1024x649.jpg?itok=fR5qCBSL&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;73f099e1-1b46-4d56-9ffd-be95acb8db4c&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;317&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-117-1024x649.jpg?itok=fR5qCBSL&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the crucial point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Corporations don’t create inflation. They merely react to changes in demand and adjust pricing and supply to maintain profitability. When the consumer slows down, corporations cut prices to reduce supply.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we should expect, consumer actions, which is how we measure inflation through the consumer price index (CPI), drive inflation risk. Consumer confidence is the key to understanding whether inflation risk is present in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-consumers-lack-confidence&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumers Lack Confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the commentary about tariff-related inflation risk, inflation is hard to achieve if consumers are unwilling or, more importantly, unable to pay higher prices. As noted in this past week’s commentary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/the-consumer-is-tapping-out/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Consumers Are Tapping Out,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; consumers show signs of deep financial stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“At the heart of the problem is the collapse of household balance sheets in the lower-income and middle-income brackets. These groups have depleted the excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and are turning to high-interest borrowing to bridge the gap. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported that the share of active credit card accounts making only minimum payments surged to 10.75% in Q3 2024—a record high. This statistic isn’t just a warning about credit health; it points to widespread cash flow stress.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, consumer confidence in finding employment continues to erode as the economy slows. Given that employment creates income for consumption, it is difficult to expand consumption (demand) if consumers do not have a job, fear losing their jobs, or wage growth stagnates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can investigate this further by examining Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), which comprise nearly 70% of the economic equation. Historically, when consumer confidence is declining, consumption also slows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-120-1024x662.jpg?itok=6UYvwhPP&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-120-1024x662.jpg?itok=6UYvwhPP&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;cb250a71-f379-4df4-9e40-28d7ac25c99d&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;323&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-120-1024x662.jpg?itok=6UYvwhPP&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, it is unsurprising that inflation is tied to consumer confidence. As consumer confidence declines, the demand for goods and services also declines. The reduction in economic activity shows up in the current inflation risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-121-1024x661.jpg?itok=tOjbgrX-&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-121-1024x661.jpg?itok=tOjbgrX-&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;83b5bec6-e5af-40ea-8a76-72a03083228a&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;323&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-121-1024x661.jpg?itok=tOjbgrX-&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Consumer stress isn’t limited to anecdotal indicators—it shows up in corporate earnings and executive commentary. During the company’s earnings call, Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart, stated that many customers are under “budget pressure.” They also exhibit “&lt;em&gt;stressed behaviors,”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; including spending reductions across general merchandise. &lt;/strong&gt;Specifically, he warned that &lt;em&gt;“For many customers, the money runs out before the month does.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos painted an equally concerning picture. He described his customers as &lt;em&gt;“struggling more than ever before&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt; Todd added that &lt;strong&gt;some are now forgoing non-discretionary items&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;like medication or hygiene products&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;to afford groceries and fuel.&lt;/strong&gt; He&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;said, &lt;em&gt;“These customers are making trade-offs we haven’t seen in years.”&lt;/em&gt; Concurring with that warning was Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup. She observed that consumers are &lt;em&gt;“becoming more cautious”&lt;/em&gt; and focusing spending on smaller, lower-cost purchases. While this signals a growing defensive posture, often associated with recessionary conditions, they are also deflationary. &lt;strong&gt;When consumer behavior shifts en masse from aspirational to survival-based, the ripple effects are inevitable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that inflation risks are extremely muted given the rapidly slowing economic backdrop and disruption in the stock and bond markets, which also impact consumer confidence. Could that change? Yes, but such a change would require a reinstatement of stimulus checks, a surge in Government spending, and the Federal Reserve increasing monetary policy. For now, none of those are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant risk to the economy is not the return of inflation risks but rather the collapse in consumer confidence that leads to a recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may have that data showing up sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Inflation Risk Is Subsiding Rapidly

            
Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,
Inflation risk has been a significant topic of discussion in the mainstream media for the last few years. Such is unsurprising given that inflation spiked following the pandemic in 2020 as consumer spending (demand) was shot into overdrive from stimulus payments and production (supply) was shuttered. To understand why that occurred, we need to revisit “Economics 101.”
“In economics, inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services. Changes in inflation are a function of fluctuations in actual demand for goods and services (also known as demand shocks, including changes in fiscal or monetary policy or recession), changes in available supplies such as during energy crises (also known as supply shocks), or changes in inflation expectations, which may be self-fulfilling. Note that supply and demand are key facets of the inflation equation.
Basic economics states prices will be set at a level where the supply of goods or services meets consumer demand.”



The economic illustration shows this basic principle taught in every “Econ 101” class. As noted, in 2020, inflation was the consequence of restricting supply and massively increasing demand.
That massive surge in stimulus sent directly to households resulted in an unprecedented spike in “savings,” creating artificial demand. As shown, the “pig in the python” effect is evident. Over the next two years, that “bulge” of excess liquidity has reverted to the previous growth trend. Given that economic growth lags behind the reversion in savings by about 12 months, we should continue to see economic growth slow into 2025. Notably, the “lag effect” is critical to the “inflation risk” thesis.



Understanding that inflation is solely a function of supply and demand, the ongoing reversal of monetary liquidity is continuing to erode economic activity. Notably, what caused the inflation spike post-2020 was not an increase in the debt or the Federal Reserve but rather the temporary increase in the money supply caused by sending checks to households. Therefore, the inflation risk will continue to subside unless the government passes a new infrastructure spending bill of massive proportions or sends another stimulus to households.
“But Lance, tariffs are inflationary.”
They aren’t for two reasons, and it all starts with consumer confidence.
Consumer Is The Key To Inflation Risk
I understand the basic assumption that if you impose a tax on a product, good, or service, then the “cost” of that product, good, or service will increase, hence the inflation risk. While that is perfectly logical, it excludes two crucial factors: 1) Only producers pay the “tax” from tariffs, and 2) we measure inflation (in terms of CPI) from the consumer side of the equation.
In “Tariffs Aren’t An Inflation Risk,” we discussed tariffs’ impact on the production side of the equation.
“Post-pandemic demand surges, supply chain disruptions, and massive fiscal and monetary interventions supported those elevated margins. As evidenced by the chart below, the correlation between economic growth rates and corporate profits is high. Note that outliers of the correlation are historically related to events such as the “Financial Crisis” and post-recession economic recoveries.”



Corporations react to cost increases in their business (i.e., wages, benefits, commodities, utilities, etc.), which must be factored into the selling price to maintain profitability. Crucially, corporations can only pass on higher input costs to consumers if demand remains higher than the available supply of those goods or services. In 2020 and 2021, corporations could pass on most of the inflationary increase to consumers as they were willing to spend the Government’s money. However, as excess savings run out, inflation declines as consumers decrease spending; corporate profits weaken as the ability to pass on higher input costs to customers fades. As shown, as inflation declines, the rate of change in corporate profits also weakens.”
Read that bolded sentence again.
When discussing inflation risk, consumer activity drives inflationary pulses in the economy. If we use a two-year average of corporate profits minus inflation, we can visualize that impact. As shown, inflationary increases, like tariffs, are only inflationary in the economy if they can be passed onto the consumer. Inflation surged in 2020 as corporations could pass on the bulk of the cost increases to consumers flush with cash. Today, to consumers. Today, inflation is declining due to declining demand. As such, the percentage of cost increases corporations must absorb is increasing, which reduces corporate profitability but shows up in the economy as slowing inflation.



Here is the crucial point:
“Corporations don’t create inflation. They merely react to changes in demand and adjust pricing and supply to maintain profitability. When the consumer slows down, corporations cut prices to reduce supply.”
As we should expect, consumer actions, which is how we measure inflation through the consumer price index (CPI), drive inflation risk. Consumer confidence is the key to understanding whether inflation risk is present in the economy.
Consumers Lack Confidence
Despite all the commentary about tariff-related inflation risk, inflation is hard to achieve if consumers are unwilling or, more importantly, unable to pay higher prices. As noted in this past week’s commentary, “Consumers Are Tapping Out,” consumers show signs of deep financial stress.
“At the heart of the problem is the collapse of household balance sheets in the lower-income and middle-income brackets. These groups have depleted the excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and are turning to high-interest borrowing to bridge the gap. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported that the share of active credit card accounts making only minimum payments surged to 10.75% in Q3 2024—a record high. This statistic isn’t just a warning about credit health; it points to widespread cash flow stress.“



Furthermore, consumer confidence in finding employment continues to erode as the economy slows. Given that employment creates income for consumption, it is difficult to expand consumption (demand) if consumers do not have a job, fear losing their jobs, or wage growth stagnates.



We can investigate this further by examining Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), which comprise nearly 70% of the economic equation. Historically, when consumer confidence is declining, consumption also slows.



As such, it is unsurprising that inflation is tied to consumer confidence. As consumer confidence declines, the demand for goods and services also declines. The reduction in economic activity shows up in the current inflation risks.



Conclusion
Lastly, Consumer stress isn’t limited to anecdotal indicators—it shows up in corporate earnings and executive commentary. During the company’s earnings call, Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart, stated that many customers are under “budget pressure.” They also exhibit “stressed behaviors,” including spending reductions across general merchandise. Specifically, he warned that “For many customers, the money runs out before the month does.”
Similarly, Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos painted an equally concerning picture. He described his customers as “struggling more than ever before.” Todd added that some are now forgoing non-discretionary items, like medication or hygiene products, to afford groceries and fuel. He said, “These customers are making trade-offs we haven’t seen in years.” Concurring with that warning was Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup. She observed that consumers are “becoming more cautious” and focusing spending on smaller, lower-cost purchases. While this signals a growing defensive posture, often associated with recessionary conditions, they are also deflationary. When consumer behavior shifts en masse from aspirational to survival-based, the ripple effects are inevitable.
The bottom line is that inflation risks are extremely muted given the rapidly slowing economic backdrop and disruption in the stock and bond markets, which also impact consumer confidence. Could that change? Yes, but such a change would require a reinstatement of stimulus checks, a surge in Government spending, and the Federal Reserve increasing monetary policy. For now, none of those are available.
The most significant risk to the economy is not the return of inflation risks but rather the collapse in consumer confidence that leads to a recession.
We may have that data showing up sooner than later.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;China Tests Novel Non-Nuclear Hydrogen Bomb - Generates Intense Fireball&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese scientists successfully detonated a powerful and innovative &lt;u&gt;non-nuclear&lt;/u&gt; hydrogen-based bomb that produced an enduring, intensely-hot fireball&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3307059/china-tests-non-nuclear-hydrogen-bomb-science-paper-shows?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=homepage&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported on Sunday, citing a research paper describing the experiment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new technology centers on the use of &lt;strong&gt;magnesium hydride (MgH2), a white or silvery crystalline powder that&apos;s capable of storing an outsize amount of hydrogen&lt;/strong&gt;. The material and its extraordinary solid-state storage potential originally piqued scientists&apos; interest for a peaceful purpose: transporting hydrogen to off-grid locations for use generating &lt;strong&gt;clean energy&lt;/strong&gt; and heat by way of fuel cells. Magnesium hydride&apos;s storage capacity is far superior to pressurized tanks, &lt;em&gt;SCMP&lt;/em&gt; explains. The material is also of interest to scientists in the field of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385632642_Using_magnesium_hydride_as_the_future_dual-mode_propellant_for_spacecraft_A_simulation_investigation&quot;&gt;spacecraft propulsion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, scientists recognized that &lt;strong&gt;densely-packed hydrogen offers extraordinary explosive potential&lt;/strong&gt;, and set out to build explosive devices to measure the destructive force. China&apos;s pioneering evaluation started small, with a test bomb weighing just 4.4 pounds (2kg). The resulting fireball impressed researchers, producing heat exceeding 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 Celsius). More importantly, &lt;strong&gt;the fireball lasted more than two seconds, which is 15 times longer than a comparably-scaled TNT explosion&lt;/strong&gt;. No nuclear materials were involved.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The test bomb was produced by the the 705 Research Institute&lt;/strong&gt;, a subsidiary operation of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). Among its many scientific endeavors, the 705 Research Institute is a leading force in China&apos;s development of underwater weapon systems. However, &lt;strong&gt;the bomb test was conducted on land&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;SCMP&lt;/em&gt;&apos;s summary of the paper didn&apos;t address any naval-kinetic-warfare implications; however, magnesium hydride is being eyed for possible use in submarine fuel cells. The peer-reviewed paper on the innovative bomb appeared in the Chinese-language Journal of Projectiles, Rockets, Missiles and Guidance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Hydrogen gas explosions ignite with minimal ignition energy, have a broad explosion range, and unleash flames that race outward rapidly while spreading widely,&lt;/strong&gt;” the research team in a peer-reviewed paper published by the Chinese-language &lt;em&gt;Journal of Projectiles, Rockets, Missiles and Guidance&lt;/em&gt;. “This combination allows &lt;strong&gt;precise control over blast intensity, easily achieving uniform destruction of targets across vast areas&lt;/strong&gt;.” In addition to that use, the 705 Research Institute&apos;s scientists also evaluated the bomb&apos;s potential use in confined attacks on high-value targets. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Producing magnesium hydride is no easy feat&lt;/strong&gt;, as the process of binding of hydrogen and magnesium necessitates high pressures and high temperatures. If air manages to infiltrate the production chamber, the facility and its workers could be incinerated in the blink of an eye. Given the demands, it can take a laboratory a full day just to generate a few grams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, however, &lt;strong&gt;China is shifting magnesium hydride production from the micro-scale of laboratories to the industrial scale of a factory &lt;/strong&gt;in the Shaanxi province in the country&apos;s northwest. Aiming to pump out a jaw-dropping &lt;strong&gt;150 tons per year, &lt;/strong&gt;the plant is the work of the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/research_news/chem/202501/t20250115_898687.shtml&quot;&gt;completed its one-year pilot phase&lt;/a&gt; on January 10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our more science-oriented &lt;em&gt;ZeroHedge&lt;/em&gt; readers, here are more details on China&apos;s magnesium hydride bomb test: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under constrained detonation, peak overpressure reached 428.43 kilopascals at two metres (6ft 7in) from the bomb – about &lt;strong&gt;40 per cent of TNT’s blast force, but with a far greater heat projection range&lt;/strong&gt;... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The chain reaction begins when detonation shock waves fracture magnesium hydride into micron-scale particles, exposing fresh surfaces&lt;/strong&gt;, according to the study. Thermal decomposition rapidly releases hydrogen gas, which mixes with ambient air. Upon reaching the lower explosive limit, the mixture ignites, triggering exothermic combustion.T&lt;strong&gt;his liberated heat further propagates magnesium hydride decomposition, creating a self-sustaining loop &lt;/strong&gt;until fuel exhaustion – a synergistic cascading of mechanical fracturing, hydrogen release, and thermal feedback -- &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3307059/china-tests-non-nuclear-hydrogen-bomb-science-paper-shows?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=homepage&quot;&gt;SCMP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long until our military-industrial complex is pointing to the Chinese magnesium-hydride menace to help justify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/military/record-breaking-1-trillion-defense-budget-trump-hegseth-say-its-happening&quot;&gt;Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth&apos;s fever dreams of a trillion-dollar military budget&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>China Tests Novel Non-Nuclear Hydrogen Bomb - Generates Intense Fireball

            
Chinese scientists successfully detonated a powerful and innovative non-nuclear hydrogen-based bomb that produced an enduring, intensely-hot fireball, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, citing a research paper describing the experiment. 
The new technology centers on the use of magnesium hydride (MgH2), a white or silvery crystalline powder that&apos;s capable of storing an outsize amount of hydrogen. The material and its extraordinary solid-state storage potential originally piqued scientists&apos; interest for a peaceful purpose: transporting hydrogen to off-grid locations for use generating clean energy and heat by way of fuel cells. Magnesium hydride&apos;s storage capacity is far superior to pressurized tanks, SCMP explains. The material is also of interest to scientists in the field of spacecraft propulsion. 
Naturally, scientists recognized that densely-packed hydrogen offers extraordinary explosive potential, and set out to build explosive devices to measure the destructive force. China&apos;s pioneering evaluation started small, with a test bomb weighing just 4.4 pounds (2kg). The resulting fireball impressed researchers, producing heat exceeding 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 Celsius). More importantly, the fireball lasted more than two seconds, which is 15 times longer than a comparably-scaled TNT explosion. No nuclear materials were involved.

The test bomb was produced by the the 705 Research Institute, a subsidiary operation of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). Among its many scientific endeavors, the 705 Research Institute is a leading force in China&apos;s development of underwater weapon systems. However, the bomb test was conducted on land and SCMP&apos;s summary of the paper didn&apos;t address any naval-kinetic-warfare implications; however, magnesium hydride is being eyed for possible use in submarine fuel cells. The peer-reviewed paper on the innovative bomb appeared in the Chinese-language Journal of Projectiles, Rockets, Missiles and Guidance. 
“Hydrogen gas explosions ignite with minimal ignition energy, have a broad explosion range, and unleash flames that race outward rapidly while spreading widely,” the research team in a peer-reviewed paper published by the Chinese-language Journal of Projectiles, Rockets, Missiles and Guidance. “This combination allows precise control over blast intensity, easily achieving uniform destruction of targets across vast areas.” In addition to that use, the 705 Research Institute&apos;s scientists also evaluated the bomb&apos;s potential use in confined attacks on high-value targets.

Producing magnesium hydride is no easy feat, as the process of binding of hydrogen and magnesium necessitates high pressures and high temperatures. If air manages to infiltrate the production chamber, the facility and its workers could be incinerated in the blink of an eye. Given the demands, it can take a laboratory a full day just to generate a few grams. 
Now, however, China is shifting magnesium hydride production from the micro-scale of laboratories to the industrial scale of a factory in the Shaanxi province in the country&apos;s northwest. Aiming to pump out a jaw-dropping 150 tons per year, the plant is the work of the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics. It completed its one-year pilot phase on January 10.

For our more science-oriented ZeroHedge readers, here are more details on China&apos;s magnesium hydride bomb test: 
Under constrained detonation, peak overpressure reached 428.43 kilopascals at two metres (6ft 7in) from the bomb – about 40 per cent of TNT’s blast force, but with a far greater heat projection range... 
The chain reaction begins when detonation shock waves fracture magnesium hydride into micron-scale particles, exposing fresh surfaces, according to the study. Thermal decomposition rapidly releases hydrogen gas, which mixes with ambient air. Upon reaching the lower explosive limit, the mixture ignites, triggering exothermic combustion.This liberated heat further propagates magnesium hydride decomposition, creating a self-sustaining loop until fuel exhaustion – a synergistic cascading of mechanical fracturing, hydrogen release, and thermal feedback -- SCMP
How long until our military-industrial complex is pointing to the Chinese magnesium-hydride menace to help justify Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth&apos;s fever dreams of a trillion-dollar military budget?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito filed a strongly worded dissent from the court’s order issued early April 19 that temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting alleged members of the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2893%29_5.jpg?itok=yKo8Ayoc&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2893%29_5.jpg?itok=yKo8Ayoc&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;01f5ecd3-e8f9-4722-997f-da57ab8512e4&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2893%29_5.jpg?itok=yKo8Ayoc&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dissenting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a1007_22p3.pdf&quot;&gt;opinion&lt;/a&gt;, which was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, was posted on the court’s website early on April 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule,&lt;/strong&gt; without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,” Alito wrote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I refused to join the Court’s order because &lt;strong&gt;we had no good reason to think that, under the circumstances, issuing an order at midnight was necessary or appropriate&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Both the Executive and the Judiciary have an obligation to follow the law. The Executive must proceed under the terms of our order in Trump v. J.G.G., and this Court should follow established procedures,” Alito wrote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The justices acted even though “it is not clear the Court had jurisdiction,” or authority to hear the case, he wrote.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The papers before us, while alleging that the applicants were in imminent danger of removal, provided little concrete support for that allegation,” Alito wrote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Trump v. J.G.G., the Supreme Court on April 7 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/supreme-court-grants-trumps-request-to-halt-order-in-deportations-case-5835290&quot;&gt;granted&lt;/a&gt; the president’s request to pause a federal district judge’s orders preventing his administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected members of Tren de Aragua but determined that detainees must be given an opportunity to challenge their removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The unsigned one-page administrative stay &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/041925zr_c18e.pdf&quot;&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; early April 19 to which Alito referred directed the federal government “not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An administrative stay gives the justices more time to consider the emergency request to block the deportations. That order did not provide an explanation of why the court acted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order was issued after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed an emergency request on behalf of two Venezuelan nationals late on April 18, asking the Supreme Court to immediately block their deportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A1007/356063/20250418172902261_2025.04.18%20AARP%20Application.pdf&quot;&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; in A.A.R.P. and W.M.M. v. Trump challenges President Donald Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport illegal immigrants who are alleged or confirmed criminal gang members. A.A.R.P. and W.M.M. are the initials of two of the detained men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ACLU also sought a temporary restraining order from the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, as well as a stay of removal order from the Fifth Circuit, according to the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 14, Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/20/2025-04865/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; Proclamation 10903, in which he officially declared that Tren de Aragua, a designated foreign terrorist organization, “is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group is using mass illegal immigration to the United States to harm U.S. citizens, undermine public safety, and support the goal of the Venezuelan socialist regime with which it is associated to destabilize “democratic nations in the Americas, including the United States,” the proclamation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The president invoked the Alien Enemies Act to authorize the “immediate apprehension, detention, and removal” of members of the group who are Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older and who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application said the ACLU’s clients are challenging the Trump administration’s use of the federal statute to deport them. The clients “are in imminent and ongoing jeopardy of being removed from the United States without notice or an opportunity to be heard, in direct contravention of this Court’s order in Trump v. J.G.G.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Many individuals have already been loaded on to buses, presumably headed to the airport,” and are at risk of being sent to a prison in El Salvador, according to the April 18 application.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On March 15, the Trump administration used the Alien Enemies Act to deport at least 137 Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they are now incarcerated “possibly for the rest of their lives” at the Salvadoran Terrorism Confinement Center, which is “one of the most notorious prisons in the world,” the application said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application alleged that many of those deported since March 15 were not members of Tren de Aragua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Such false accusations are particularly devastating given the present Applicants’ strong claims for relief under our immigration laws,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;the application said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application came one day after U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix of the Northern District of Texas denied the ACLU clients’ request for a temporary restraining order halting removal efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hendrix rejected the ACLU’s claim that its clients were “at imminent risk of summary removal” because the government denied the allegation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late on April 19, Solicitor General D. John Sauer urged the Supreme Court to deny the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“At a minimum, if the Court keeps its administrative stay in place, the government respectfully requests that the Court clarify that it is administratively staying removals only under the [Alien Enemies Act], and that its order does not preclude removal pursuant to any other immigration authorities,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Sauer wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

The emergency application in A.A.R.P. and W.M.M. v. Trump challenges President Donald Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport illegal immigrants who are alleged or confirmed criminal gang members. A.A.R.P. and W.M.M. are the initials of two of the detained men.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Japan Considers Easing Car Safety Standards As Part Of Potential New Trade Deal&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks as though trade progress is being made with Japan, as concessions about automobiles were reported on this weekend, signaling that Trump administration could be heading towards a revised agreement with the key ally nation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan may loosen auto safety rules for U.S. imports to address President Trump’s concerns over the low number of American cars sold there, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports. With differing safety standards between the two countries, Tokyo is eyeing crash test regulations as a possible trade concession, &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/Trump-tariffs/Japan-to-put-car-safety-standards-on-table-in-Trump-tariffs-talks&quot;&gt;according to Nikkei&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a White House meeting, Trump criticized Japan’s trade surplus and poor U.S. auto sales. Cabinet-level talks focused on non-tariff barriers, particularly in the auto and agriculture sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/trump%20japan.jpg?itok=9y8IB_kZ&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/trump%20japan.jpg?itok=9y8IB_kZ&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;9c028fab-275c-499c-a599-7e2b6e196cbf&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/trump%20japan.jpg?itok=9y8IB_kZ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, a signatory to a 1958 U.N. pact on unified auto standards, maintains its own certification process, requiring separate approval for American imports—a process that can take months. While the U.S. participates in discussions under the U.N. framework, it uses its own safety rules and lets automakers self-test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/Trump-tariffs/Japan-to-put-car-safety-standards-on-table-in-Trump-tariffs-talks&quot;&gt;report says&lt;/a&gt; that the U.S. Trade Representative recently flagged Japan’s crash test requirements as a non-tariff barrier, citing them as overly burdensome and unfair to U.S. carmakers. These safety standards—especially for frontal and side collisions—have long been a sticking point in trade talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During past Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, Japan agreed to ease some requirements for U.S. imports, such as skipping certain tests like fire retardancy. It also expanded exemptions for low-volume American car sales. However, those TPP concessions faded after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

During a White House meeting, Trump criticized Japan’s trade surplus and poor U.S. auto sales. Cabinet-level talks focused on non-tariff barriers, particularly in the auto and agriculture sectors.



Japan, a signatory to a 1958 U.N. pact on unified auto standards, maintains its own certification process, requiring separate approval for American imports—a process that can take months. While the U.S. participates in discussions under the U.N. framework, it uses its own safety rules and lets automakers self-test.
The Nikkei report says that the U.S. Trade Representative recently flagged Japan’s crash test requirements as a non-tariff barrier, citing them as overly burdensome and unfair to U.S. carmakers. These safety standards—especially for frontal and side collisions—have long been a sticking point in trade talks.
During past Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, Japan agreed to ease some requirements for U.S. imports, such as skipping certain tests like fire retardancy. It also expanded exemptions for low-volume American car sales. However, those TPP concessions faded after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact in 2017.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;A Conspiracy Theory That Is Being Pushed By The Left Claims That Something Really Big Is Going To Happen Today&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://endoftheamericandream.com/a-conspiracy-theory-that-is-being-pushed-by-the-left-claims-that-something-really-big-is-going-to-happen-on-april-20th/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Michael Snyder via The End of The American Dream blog,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most people on the right have no idea just how crazed many people on the left have become. &lt;/strong&gt; Right now, a conspiracy theory which claims that President Trump is preparing to declare martial law in the United States is spreading like wildfire on social media. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; According to that conspiracy theory, a report will be submitted to President Trump on April 20th which will recommend that he should invoke the Insurrection Act to help deal with the border crisis.  &lt;strong&gt;That would allow U.S. troops to help secure the border, but many leftists are convinced that President Trump will also use U.S. troops to round up political activists and send them to prisons in El Salvador.&lt;/strong&gt;  I realize that this may sound really bizarre to many of you, but this is what many of them actually believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Snip20250414_65.jpg?itok=azhsMbu9&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Snip20250414_65.jpg?itok=azhsMbu9&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;bca1c3bc-e651-4994-89d2-80169062b428&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;438&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Snip20250414_65.jpg?itok=azhsMbu9&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early last month, an article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/insurrection-act-president-trump-20201819.php&quot;&gt;that was published by the San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt; got the ball rolling by highlighting&lt;/strong&gt; the fact that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security will soon submit a report to President Trump recommending whether or not to invoke the Insurrection Act…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock is ticking down on a crucial but little-noticed part of President Donald Trump’s first round of executive orders — the one tasking the secretaries of the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to submit a joint report, within 90 days, recommending “whether to invoke the Insurrection Act.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us are now holding our collective breath, knowing that the report and what it contains could put us on the slippery slope toward unchecked presidential power under a man with an affinity for ironfisted dictators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is not exactly an honest characterization of what that executive order says. &lt;/strong&gt; I have reproduced the relevant portion of that particular executive order &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-emergency-at-the-southern-border-of-the-united-states/&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 90 days of the date of this proclamation, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a joint report to the President about the conditions at the southern border of the United States and any recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration wants to use U.S. troops to help secure the border, and that is probably what we are going to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many leftists are absolutely convinced that we are also about to see martial law in this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An article that was authored by an anonymous leftist known as “Aletheisthenes” that was entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@aletheisthenes/on-april-20th-2025-the-united-states-will-cross-the-point-of-no-return-0aecac04cfc3&quot;&gt;“Part 1: On April 20th, 2025, the United States may Cross the Point of No Return”&lt;/a&gt; has created a firestorm of panic among far left radicals. &lt;/strong&gt; According to that article, once President Trump officially invokes the Insurrection Act it will set a “larger plan in motion”…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as his two months in office has already shown, he won’t stop at just a legal opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect an executive order even that same day or the next, officially declaring the Insurrection Act, restricting freedoms in the name of restoring control of the border and perhaps in blue-state cities, and setting the larger plan in motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this won’t be framed as an attack on democracy. It will be packaged as a necessary response to crisis — as authoritarian takeovers always are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once it happens, there’s no going back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be the point of no return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aletheisthenes believes that the plan to implement martial law in this nation will unfold &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@aletheisthenes/on-april-20th-2025-the-united-states-will-cross-the-point-of-no-return-0aecac04cfc3&quot;&gt;in eight stages&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. “Resist!” Demonstrations Grow — Just As Planned&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. The False Flag Crisis: Turning Protest into “Terror”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Trump Declares Expanded Martial Law — And Calls for Militia to assist the police and Military&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Mass Arrests of Opposition Leaders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Military &amp; National Guard Take Over Major Cities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Press Censorship &amp; Total Media Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. Borders Close &amp; Dissidents Are Trapped Inside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Elections Are “Postponed” Indefinitely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Needless to say, this is not what Trump intends to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do believe that anti-Trump protests funded by very deep pockets on the left will continue to grow, and every time President Trump does something to try to keep those protests under control it will fuel their delusions even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aletheisthenes followed up his original article with another very popular article in which he claimed that Trump’s ultimate goal is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@aletheisthenes/if-the-shit-actually-hits-the-fan-b491462c6057&quot;&gt;“fully overthrow the United States government”&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On or slightly after April 20th, 2025, &lt;strong&gt;Trump will most likely sign an executive order invoking the Insurrection Act.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excuse will be to secure the border and deport violent gang member illegal aliens, and possibly bring order to out-of-control cities, but it will actually be the first step to eventually fully declare martial law across the United States, and suspend civil liberties, and the US Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To most it will come &lt;strong&gt;without warning&lt;/strong&gt;. The press might not even report on it until the last minute. When it happens, expect &lt;strong&gt;confusion, misinformation, and panic&lt;/strong&gt;. Many will be caught off guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(But &lt;strong&gt;a few of us won’t be, &lt;/strong&gt;at least not entirely — because we saw this coming.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ultimate purpose is to eventually fully overthrow the United States government, put Trump, his billionaire co-conspirators, and people who share the values of his very fuzzy reactionary political coalition fully and permanently in control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But this is what they actually believe, and they are going to act accordingly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative that President Trump is some sort of a dictator will motivate leftists to show up at protests, and when some of those protests inevitably turn violent and authorities are forced to respond it will cause even more easily fooled people to embrace that narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see what leftists are already saying on social media.  Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pcmzn3lb3n6vha766ajfsee6/post/3lmkhhu2bwc2w&quot;&gt;just one example&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a veteran, if martial law is declared in the U.S., it means the Constitution is suspended. Civilian government Gone. Freedom of speech, assembly, the press? Gone. Curfews. Checkpoints. Arrest without warrants. No due process. I believe the military would stand with the people &amp; Constitution”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are openly talking about civil conflict, and this has been going on for months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But most people on the right have no idea this is happening.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conspiracy theory that I have discussed in this article has gained so much traction that Snopes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/09/trump-martial-law-insurrection-act/&quot;&gt;was even forced to address it&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reader emailed Snopes, “I am seeing many posts on Facebook that on April 20, Trump will declare martial law.” Another person referenced an executive order issued on Jan. 20, the first day of Trump’s second term, and asked, “I have seen a variety of posts suggesting that an early executive order signed by the president has set the stage for the imposition of martial law, and that this will be triggered by a report on the state of the border that will be released on April 20. Any truth here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, Snopes considers this conspiracy theory to be more of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/09/trump-martial-law-insurrection-act/&quot;&gt;“a prediction than a provable claim”&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing on April 9, this rumor existed more as a prediction than a provable claim. Searches of the websites for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/XOOgA&quot;&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/xSKMS&quot;&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/CwnaJ&quot;&gt;White&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/pNkbn&quot;&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; yielded no announcements, statements or demonstrable evidence that might help to shed light on the unproven matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually think that there are many on the left that would love to see President Trump declare martial law, because they are convinced that would give them justification for what they have been intending to do all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have never been more divided as a society than we are right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil disorder on a scale that we have never seen before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM6S4V9V&quot;&gt;is coming&lt;/a&gt;, but even after all of the political violence that we have already witnessed in recent weeks a lot of people still don’t want to believe it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sticking our heads in the sand won’t make the threat go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our society is reaching a boiling point, and it won’t be too long before events spiral completely out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>A Conspiracy Theory That Is Being Pushed By The Left Claims That Something Really Big Is Going To Happen Today

            
Authored by Michael Snyder via The End of The American Dream blog,
Most people on the right have no idea just how crazed many people on the left have become.  Right now, a conspiracy theory which claims that President Trump is preparing to declare martial law in the United States is spreading like wildfire on social media. 
 According to that conspiracy theory, a report will be submitted to President Trump on April 20th which will recommend that he should invoke the Insurrection Act to help deal with the border crisis.  That would allow U.S. troops to help secure the border, but many leftists are convinced that President Trump will also use U.S. troops to round up political activists and send them to prisons in El Salvador.  I realize that this may sound really bizarre to many of you, but this is what many of them actually believe.

But once it happens, there’s no going back.
This will be the point of no return.
Aletheisthenes believes that the plan to implement martial law in this nation will unfold in eight stages…
1. “Resist!” Demonstrations Grow — Just As Planned
2. The False Flag Crisis: Turning Protest into “Terror”
3. Trump Declares Expanded Martial Law — And Calls for Militia to assist the police and Military
4. Mass Arrests of Opposition Leaders

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Initial reports indicate that there are no injuries or fatalities at this time. However, as with all ongoing investigations, details may change.

      <contentSnippet>Explosion Rocks Northrop Grumman Solid Rocket Facility In Utah

            
Northrop Grumman&apos;s mission to design and build the world&apos;s largest and most advanced solid rocket motors may have been derailed last week after an explosion rocked its Promontory, Utah, facility.
Local media Fox 13 reported that one of the aerospace and defense technology company&apos;s buildings at the Promontory test facility was destroyed in an explosion last Wednesday morning. When emergency responders arrived at the incident area, they found one building destroyed. 
&quot;Initial reports indicate that there are no injuries or fatalities at this time. However, as with all ongoing investigations, details may change. There is no further information available for release at this time.  We advise the public to avoid the area,&quot; the Box Elder County Sheriff&apos;s Office wrote on a Facebook post hours after the explosion. 



Northrop Grumman told Fox 13 that the building destroyed was used to &quot;produce an ingredient in solid rocket motor propellant and is one of many in its production network,&quot; adding that no solid rocket motors were destroyed or damaged in the blast.
Here&apos;s more context on the explosion and its potential impact, via Space.com:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is removing pharmaceutical company representatives from advisory committees in a bid to limit industry influence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%281496%29_0.jpg?itok=nQWJCVOv&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%281496%29_0.jpg?itok=nQWJCVOv&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;215e11be-5623-4635-b329-cb2d32303858&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%281496%29_0.jpg?itok=nQWJCVOv&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Marty Makary, then the nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration, testifies during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 6, 2025. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marty Makary, the FDA’s new commissioner, issued a directive that eliminates the role of pharmaceutical representative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Industry employees are welcome to attend FDA advisory committee meetings, along with the rest of the American public, but having industry employees serve as official members of FDA advisory committee members represents a cozy relationship that is concerning to many Americans,&lt;/strong&gt;” Makary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-commissioner-makary-announces-new-policy-individuals-serving-fda-advisory-committees&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement on April 17. “In fact, the FDA has a history of being influenced unduly by corporate interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA has 32 different advisory committees, including panels that advise the agency on vaccines, food, and medical devices. Members are primarily a mix of federal employees and experts who do not work for industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But each FDA committee has an industry representative and an alternate industry representative. The Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, for instance, had a Pfizer officer and a Dynavax officer listed on the roster for its most recent meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry representatives do not vote on what advice to convey to the FDA, but “offer perspective of a pharmaceutical company,” Kim Witczak, who has served on several FDA advisory committees, told The Epoch Times in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes they will say something that could influence or sway the discussion. I always wondered why they were on the committee&lt;/strong&gt;,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA did not release Makary’s directive but described it as limiting people employed at companies regulated by the FDA, such as pharmaceutical firms, from serving as members of FDA advisory committees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today’s action will not preclude employees of regulated companies from attending or presenting their views at advisory committee meetings or serving as representative members of the committee when required by statute,” the agency stated. “Also, exceptions can be made in rare circumstances (i.e., when the scientific expertise in an area is only available from an employee of an FDA-regulated company) provided that the official strictly complies with the applicable ethics requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Makary said the directive was issued to make sure scientific evaluation of new products is independent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Public trust in the healthcare-industrial complex is at an all-time low. We need to restore impeccable integrity to the process and avoid potential conflicts of interest,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PhRMA, a trade group for the pharmaceutical industry, did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Hamas Video Shows Israeli Hostage Urging Trump To Gain His Release&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday the armed wing of Hamas, known as the Qassam Brigades, issued a &apos;proof of life&apos; video showing Israeli hostage Elkana Buhbut &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/israeli-hostage-trump/2025/04/19/id/1207501/&quot;&gt;speaking to his US national wife&lt;/a&gt; in a phone call, requesting that President Donald Trump release hostages from Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elkana&apos;s family released a statement alongside the video: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;For 535 days Elkana has been trapped in an ongoing hell,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; the family said. &quot;The video reveals his dire condition – he has lost substantial weight from prolonged starvation, suffers from skin and respiratory problems in addition to his asthma, and has been deprived of daylight for nearly a year and a half.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/elkana.jpg?itok=e4KV7BuZ&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/elkana.jpg?itok=e4KV7BuZ&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ed107c47-8d2c-4185-8835-9c2b4f4c7672&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/elkana.jpg?itok=e4KV7BuZ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This footage provides further evidence that Elkana must be returned home to his family, to his wife Rivka and son Re&apos;em David immediately,&quot; the statement read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Elkana is desperately calling for help, begging not to be forgotten in these hellish tunnels. &lt;strong&gt;We urgently appeal to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; – please consider this as if he were your own son, the father of your grandchild, who is waiting to see daylight, hearing IDF bombs overhead while living in constant fear for his life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump has lately appeared to back Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&apos;s pledge to unleash &quot;hell&quot; in Gaza and pursue &quot;complete victory&quot; against Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this plan has outraged families of the remaining captives, who are demanding that the broken ceasefire be renewed at least until they can get their loved ones back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t the first time that Buhbut has been featured in a Hamas propaganda video. Some pundits accused Hamas of staging a fake phone call for the Buhbut hostage video...&lt;/p&gt;

At the same time, Palestinian officials have asserted that the group will &lt;strong&gt;&quot;never disarm&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; until a Palestinian state is created. Israel fears the terror group would just rise up again and resume rocket launches on its territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point there seems little hope for a renewed truce, as Israel has fully committed to a renewed air and ground campaign, and has kept Rafah and other cities surrounded and under military occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

Earlier this month Hamas said it is ready to release all remaining hostages if a permanent ceasefire is reached. At the same time, Palestinian officials have asserted that the group will &quot;never disarm&quot; until a Palestinian state is created. Israel fears the terror group would just rise up again and resume rocket launches on its territory.

      <title>Switching From The Tariff Phase To The Deal Phase</title>
      <link>https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/switching-tariff-phase-deal-phase</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Switching From The Tariff Phase To The Deal Phase&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Peter Tchir of Academy Securities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dealpalooza&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a relatively quiet week on the tariff front. Last Friday night we had more tariff exemptions, followed by promises (or threats) of sectoral tariffs. &lt;strong&gt;But since then, the chatter has become all about the deals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, there is the talk about firing Fed Chair Powell, but away from that, &lt;strong&gt;on the economic front, we seemed to have switched from the tariff phase to the deal phase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not think firing Powell would be a good thing over time. It would be a step towards reducing (or eliminating) the Fed’s independence. I don’t always agree with their policy. I do think it is weird that they feel the need to have less dissent than the politburo on their votes. But I think the appearance (and largely reality) of Fed independence helps the dollar and the Treasury market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But markets are more likely to move on “deals” than anything else in the coming days and weeks &lt;/strong&gt;(assuming some new, major topic doesn’t get introduced into the conversation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Deal Messaging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The administration is touting deals. Progress. More deals&lt;/strong&gt;. However, the administration seems to have backed off from stating that countries are begging for deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. messaging is clear (and less aggressive than before):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Countries are calling. Countries are lined up.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We will get deals. Good deals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;messaging from the rest of the world &lt;/strong&gt;is far from clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Japan specifically met on trade and provided almost no detail. Neither side seems to have leaked any details.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;China has said very little, if anything, through official channels. Not too surprising as they are “public enemy number 1” but it doesn’t support the administration’s messaging that China is coming for a deal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I’ve spent hours looking for details on the deals, from the U.S. and abroad, and cannot find anything outside of the U.S. Even within the U.S. the messaging seems a bit mixed, though it is still leaning towards rectifying unfair situations and improving trade balances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With little to no information, we have to guess which is an issue, but at least it can help us prepare a plan for how to react to the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What Are Tariffs Meant to Achieve?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first problem in trying to evaluate our trade and tariff policy is trying to understand what tariffs are supposed to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bargaining position.&lt;/strong&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure what we are bargaining for, but this would indicate that tariffs would be temporary.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased sales of Made in the U.S.A.&lt;/strong&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imported goods would rise in cost relative to domestic goods, which should increase domestic sales. That requires tariffs to stay in place.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;If tariffs against the U.S. are reduced or eliminated, then American made goods would be less expensive to import. &lt;strong&gt;This would likely occur only if the tariffs were temporary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A revenue source&lt;/strong&gt;. Tariffs would have to remain in place for them to generate money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the objectives that have been presented by senior people in the administration &lt;strong&gt;cannot co-exist&lt;/strong&gt;. Deciphering which reasons are most important has been incredibly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question that comes to mind is &lt;strong&gt;how big of an impact will tariffs have on the ability to increase sales of Made in America products?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If tariffs stay in place&lt;/strong&gt;, will the price increase on imports be enough to drive Made in America sales? Will it be enough to invest in factories, etc., to build more to sell?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If other countries abandon tariffs&lt;/strong&gt;, how much will Made in America sales increase? Very difficult to tell as non-tariff barriers can be as impactful or more impactful than tariffs. Also, it is unclear how much is a &lt;strong&gt;function of demand for American products, &lt;/strong&gt;as opposed to tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that part of the equation as clear as mud, let’s move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Missing in Trade Math&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we can all safely agree that &lt;strong&gt;the administration is focused on trade deficits&lt;/strong&gt;. We can all argue about a lot of things, but this much is clear. It is consistent with Trump 1.0 as well. Heck, it is consistent with things President Trump said long before he became president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two things that I think are insane to be left out of the trade conversation, yet they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The trade balance of services.&lt;/strong&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why aren’t services included in our overall analysis of trade with other countries? &lt;strong&gt;The U.S. currently has service surpluses with most countries. &lt;/strong&gt;Maybe it is more difficult to imagine “cloud computing” being manufactured, but it is the sort of thing that the U.S. is exporting – very effectively. Since we all know that the U.S. has become a service economy (for better or worse), it seems insane not to include this number as part of any overall trade analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profitability of trade.&lt;/strong&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I assume some things are more profitable than others. If we export things with a higher profit margin than the profit margin made on what we import, basic trade balances overstate the issue. If I buy $200 of stuff from you, that you make 10% on, but sell to you $100 of stuff we make 20% on, are we more balanced than a 2:1 import vs. export ratio would indicate? I think somewhere in the conversation there should be a consideration about profitability, but nowhere does that seem to show up. Services that we export are likely very high profit margin.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of other things “irk” me. Not insane, but curious at least, why they don’t come up more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raw materials and intermediate goods, versus finished products&lt;/strong&gt;. I haven’t spent much time on this, but it seems to be that knowing more details about this type of trade would help us make better decisions. Are all trade balances equally bad?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens to goods manufactured for an American company that don’t come to America&lt;/strong&gt;? I presume (for many global companies) that only a portion of the goods they make come back to the U.S. Some are probably sold in China. I assume, that for many, if you want to sell into Asia, you don’t bring them back to the U.S. to sell into Asia. So, an American company that builds something overseas and then doesn’t import it helps that American company. Though conversely, that also means that even more things could be made here because the trade deficit is even worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how we got to where we are on trade balances, but I suspect a more detailed discussion and analysis would reduce the perceived problem, rather than amplifying it. But that is not where we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tariff Rollout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before thinking about what deals might occur, we do need to look at the tariff rollout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China, Canada, and Mexico&lt;/strong&gt;. Initial wave of tariffs were given a “Fentanyl Reprieve” for Canada and Mexico. Despite what looked like some efforts on that front (especially from Mexico) the tariffs went ahead as the fentanyl reprieve was waived. Maybe the reprieve can come back again. The initial reprieve was positive regarding how the U.S. might address tariffs, but that went to the wayside and hinted at some level of confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steel and Aluminum. &lt;/strong&gt;Separate from other tariffs and were implemented globally. Demonstrated the administration was serious about tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backing off on USMCA Compliant Goods. &lt;/strong&gt;First autos and then all USMCA compliant goods were exempted from the Canada/Mexico tariffs. Seems like this could have been anticipated, which likely affects how countries come to the negotiating table.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Liberation Day tariffs. &lt;/strong&gt;Literally instant disbelief over the numbers presented. Reciprocal tariffs were anything but reciprocal. To the rest of the world, this looked like the U.S. had gone “off the deep end” on tariffs. (Even to many in the states).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Liberation Day tariffs went into effect. &lt;/strong&gt;More confusion for markets.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;90-Day Reprieve and “Reciprocal” Tariffs of “only” 10%. &lt;/strong&gt;What an amazing rally in the stock market. Suddenly 90 days to negotiate (which seems like it would have made sense from day 1). Also, while 10% is at the high side of overall tariffs between countries, it was at least in the ballpark. China was not given a break. It seemed like maybe the administration was reading the T-Reports, and this had pulled us back to the “somewhat reasonable” zone and clearly indicated that China was the main priority.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some further exemptions on products, primarily tech. &lt;/strong&gt;Another thing that made sense, though this looked like the U.S. was once again backing down on something they could have foreseen as an issue.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then statements about how National Security and sectoral tariffs would pick up the slack here&lt;/strong&gt;. Though it has been quiet since then.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further restrictions on what chips can be sold to China&lt;/strong&gt;. Hit some U.S. stocks, but further enforced the view that China is public enemy number 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the tariffs have been rolled out and have evolved, I think is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Foreign Mindset Coming Into Negotiations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As countries come to the negotiating table, I think this is a reasonable assessment of their state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some confusion over why they were targeted &lt;/strong&gt;and the amount they were targeted with.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some trepidation about needing the U.S. market&lt;/strong&gt;, but also about how much they can depend on any deal going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least somewhat encouraged by what they may see as a series of miscalculations &lt;/strong&gt;where the administration had to back down because of damage done to our markets or economy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art of the Deal is quite simple and easily understood&lt;/strong&gt;. During Trump 1.0, few seemed to understand that. This time, many, particularly Xi, seem to understand that. Presumably, Trump knows that others know the art of the deal and they are adapting. Though, given how events have unfolded, I am not sure that the U.S. policy wasn’t dependent on getting the same reactions from world leaders as they received under Trump 1.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My view is that countries are coming in concerned about the economic impact on their country, but with the sense that mistakes have been made, and there is some lack of trust&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. deals are going to be viewed as a stopgap solution, giving them time to figure out longer-term solutions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Deals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we get to the main point. &lt;strong&gt;Are we going to get “rip your face off” rallies on the back of deals? &lt;/strong&gt;Or will deals or the lack of deals drag markets (and the economy) lower?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Face-saving deal. &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s for a moment assume the administration has had a “rethink” on tariff and trade policy. That they are hearing from so many businesses that the tariff policy as enacted is not helpful. That bringing manufacturing jobs back to America will take years (and would be better accomplished by focusing on domestic policy first, to get the ball rolling). The administration has clearly backed off, so, what would a face-saving deal look like?

	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced tariffs on both sides. &lt;/strong&gt;I’m 98% convinced this could have been achieved without taking many of the steps that have hurt the administration. The other countries, at this stage, are far more likely to understand both the tariff and non-tariff barriers they have in place and where to cave and where not to cave to get the best deal for themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commitments to buy American made goods &lt;/strong&gt;– with a focus on defense and agriculture. No real teeth to enforce compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some commitment to not allowing China to use them to change “country of origin” designations&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s a bit tricky, but not a big deal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My estimate for this type of deal being offered by the U.S. to most countries has jumped from about 20% likely to 70% likely &lt;/strong&gt;(given recent news flow and actions around tariffs).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The administration can claim a win, and anyone trying to point out that these results could have been achieved without damaging the U.S. reputation, will be shouted down in social media. The end state will be a similar economy to what we had before. Tariffs were only a portion of the problem, and a minor one at that. Countries won’t increase their actual purchases of U.S. goods for long. They will take the lull to figure out ways to be less dependent on the U.S. &lt;strong&gt;So, markets may rally on the first deal headline or two, but fade as markets will establish that the U.S. economy and U.S. corporations are in a worse spot after these deals than before this whole thing started.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real Trade Balance Deals. &lt;/strong&gt;If the side that has advocated for bringing production home wins, then the U.S. will need deals like this:
	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commitment to buy American made goods, with hard figures and punishments for failing to comply&lt;/strong&gt;. A real effort to ramp up sales of American made goods. Countries commit to buying from America and face punishment (presumably high tariffs) for failing to comply. This might be difficult for many countries to agree to.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restrictions on business with China. &lt;/strong&gt;At the very least, countries will be forced to acknowledge that China can not use them as a conduit to change country of origination. The U.S. may try to get other countries to tariff China (which would make U.S. imports look cheap relative to China). Some willingness to combat China’s worst offenses is likely palatable, but countries will be careful about being too aggressive against China, given China’s size, and in some cases, its proximity. Also, given the erratic nature of U.S. trade policy since the inauguration, countries have to be more hesitant to be perceived as anti-China than before the policies were launched.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariffs as a mix of revenue, punishment, and wins. &lt;/strong&gt;Tariffs drop in importance if the true aim is to get trade balances in line.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It would be nice if the two things that I think are missing from the tariff math are incorporated &lt;/strong&gt;into the administration’s view, as the starting point would be much closer than it is currently being viewed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s assume this approach is now only used 30% of the time. &lt;/strong&gt;I think this approach has a very low success rate. Countries, for a variety of reasons, are likely to resist this. As time goes on, if we don’t get deals, the market will sense that the U.S. has over-reached and will have to price in more economic problems and lower corporate profits. If the U.S. gets deals of this nature, it would be a big and actual win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Path of Negotiations and Deals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My base case is that the U.S. likely started down the “&lt;strong&gt;Real Trade Balance Deals&lt;/strong&gt;” path and that is why we are hearing so little from other countries. They are potentially left confused or even flabbergasted by U.S. demands and are not in a rush to sign that type of deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe some countries cave and sign that type of deal, bringing more countries to that type of deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we go weeks without deals, or worse, leaks that countries are far apart, look for the negotiating strategy to shift to “&lt;strong&gt;Face Saving Deals&lt;/strong&gt;” (if it hasn’t already).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong on how I read the “cards” at the table, but that is my best estimate of who is holding what. I think the biggest risk for markets and the economy, is that one side thinks their cards are far better than they are (and from what I’ve seen so far, that risk seems to be more likely on the American side). That would mean the problems in the global economy would mount and the risk of a deep recession would grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Damage to the American Brand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the entire world lets bygones be bygones, we can get back to roughly where we were before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don’t see that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think there will be an extended period where American stocks, bonds, and products suffer from the geopolitical and economic actions taken.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to be wrong here, but I don’t think I am. Especially since even if deals are signed, the news flow, economically, geopolitically, and domestically will certainly highlight divisiveness that doesn’t help heal any wounds that have been created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the volatility and “beta” to any given headline has been reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this is a path back to where we all thought we were headed – growth fueled by business-friendly strategies. &lt;/strong&gt;Taking actions to spur the development of domestic industries, with an emphasis on issues linked to National Security. The extraction and PROCESSING of commodities, especially those that are energy-related, or crucial to future tech. Chips. A more domestic-focused policy can achieve the goals over time, and have a narrower range of outcomes (that are more predictable than trying to rebalance global trade relationships, that took years to form, in a matter of months).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pivot is required, and we might get it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be pleasantly surprised to see some very strong trade deals announced, but my base case is that we realize that this approach isn’t working, and we wind up getting some face-saving deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The economy is slowing&lt;/strong&gt;, and I think that will become more evident in the coming weeks (unless I’m surprised on the “big trade deal” front).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S., as an investment choice, a tourist destination, or a brand more broadly, is going to act to slow the economy and markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should be good for rates, but all the hope about deficit reduction seems to be diminishing. Much of what I think would be required to make a pivot successful will involve spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that keeps bonds in a range (maybe a wide range of 4.1% to 4.5% on 10s) but a range, nonetheless. At the moment, the risk of breaking out of this range is to the higher yield side. I see more headline risk to bonds than optimism, especially on the deficit side of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equities will suffer, in dribs and drabs, if the U.S. doesn’t back down on what we hope to achieve in trade negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, it comes down to undoing a lot on the trade front and pivoting sharply to doing what is in primarily U.S. control.&lt;br /&gt;
Good luck and hopefully the shelf life of this thought process is more than a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate at which announcements shaping the geopolitical environment, the economic environment, and the investing landscape is staggering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you have been able to use the long weekend to regroup and get ready for more! And hopefully it is Dealpalooza time – we could all use that!&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Switching From The Tariff Phase To The Deal Phase

            
By Peter Tchir of Academy Securities
Dealpalooza
It was a relatively quiet week on the tariff front. Last Friday night we had more tariff exemptions, followed by promises (or threats) of sectoral tariffs. But since then, the chatter has become all about the deals.
Ok, there is the talk about firing Fed Chair Powell, but away from that, on the economic front, we seemed to have switched from the tariff phase to the deal phase.
I do not think firing Powell would be a good thing over time. It would be a step towards reducing (or eliminating) the Fed’s independence. I don’t always agree with their policy. I do think it is weird that they feel the need to have less dissent than the politburo on their votes. But I think the appearance (and largely reality) of Fed independence helps the dollar and the Treasury market.
But markets are more likely to move on “deals” than anything else in the coming days and weeks (assuming some new, major topic doesn’t get introduced into the conversation).
Deal Messaging
The administration is touting deals. Progress. More deals. However, the administration seems to have backed off from stating that countries are begging for deals.
The U.S. messaging is clear (and less aggressive than before):
Countries are calling. Countries are lined up.
We will get deals. Good deals.
The messaging from the rest of the world is far from clear:
Japan specifically met on trade and provided almost no detail. Neither side seems to have leaked any details.
China has said very little, if anything, through official channels. Not too surprising as they are “public enemy number 1” but it doesn’t support the administration’s messaging that China is coming for a deal.
I’ve spent hours looking for details on the deals, from the U.S. and abroad, and cannot find anything outside of the U.S. Even within the U.S. the messaging seems a bit mixed, though it is still leaning towards rectifying unfair situations and improving trade balances.
With little to no information, we have to guess which is an issue, but at least it can help us prepare a plan for how to react to the headlines.
What Are Tariffs Meant to Achieve?
The first problem in trying to evaluate our trade and tariff policy is trying to understand what tariffs are supposed to achieve.
A bargaining position.

	
I’m not sure what we are bargaining for, but this would indicate that tariffs would be temporary.

	
Increased sales of Made in the U.S.A.
	
Imported goods would rise in cost relative to domestic goods, which should increase domestic sales. That requires tariffs to stay in place.
If tariffs against the U.S. are reduced or eliminated, then American made goods would be less expensive to import. This would likely occur only if the tariffs were temporary.

	
A revenue source. Tariffs would have to remain in place for them to generate money.
Some of the objectives that have been presented by senior people in the administration cannot co-exist. Deciphering which reasons are most important has been incredibly difficult.
One question that comes to mind is how big of an impact will tariffs have on the ability to increase sales of Made in America products?
If tariffs stay in place, will the price increase on imports be enough to drive Made in America sales? Will it be enough to invest in factories, etc., to build more to sell?
If other countries abandon tariffs, how much will Made in America sales increase? Very difficult to tell as non-tariff barriers can be as impactful or more impactful than tariffs. Also, it is unclear how much is a function of demand for American products, as opposed to tariffs.
With that part of the equation as clear as mud, let’s move on.
What is Missing in Trade Math
I think we can all safely agree that the administration is focused on trade deficits. We can all argue about a lot of things, but this much is clear. It is consistent with Trump 1.0 as well. Heck, it is consistent with things President Trump said long before he became president.
There are two things that I think are insane to be left out of the trade conversation, yet they are.
The trade balance of services.

	
Why aren’t services included in our overall analysis of trade with other countries? The U.S. currently has service surpluses with most countries. Maybe it is more difficult to imagine “cloud computing” being manufactured, but it is the sort of thing that the U.S. is exporting – very effectively. Since we all know that the U.S. has become a service economy (for better or worse), it seems insane not to include this number as part of any overall trade analysis.

	
Profitability of trade.
	
I assume some things are more profitable than others. If we export things with a higher profit margin than the profit margin made on what we import, basic trade balances overstate the issue. If I buy $200 of stuff from you, that you make 10% on, but sell to you $100 of stuff we make 20% on, are we more balanced than a 2:1 import vs. export ratio would indicate? I think somewhere in the conversation there should be a consideration about profitability, but nowhere does that seem to show up. Services that we export are likely very high profit margin.


A couple of other things “irk” me. Not insane, but curious at least, why they don’t come up more.
Raw materials and intermediate goods, versus finished products. I haven’t spent much time on this, but it seems to be that knowing more details about this type of trade would help us make better decisions. Are all trade balances equally bad?
What happens to goods manufactured for an American company that don’t come to America? I presume (for many global companies) that only a portion of the goods they make come back to the U.S. Some are probably sold in China. I assume, that for many, if you want to sell into Asia, you don’t bring them back to the U.S. to sell into Asia. So, an American company that builds something overseas and then doesn’t import it helps that American company. Though conversely, that also means that even more things could be made here because the trade deficit is even worse.
I’m not sure how we got to where we are on trade balances, but I suspect a more detailed discussion and analysis would reduce the perceived problem, rather than amplifying it. But that is not where we are.
The Tariff Rollout
Before thinking about what deals might occur, we do need to look at the tariff rollout.
China, Canada, and Mexico. Initial wave of tariffs were given a “Fentanyl Reprieve” for Canada and Mexico. Despite what looked like some efforts on that front (especially from Mexico) the tariffs went ahead as the fentanyl reprieve was waived. Maybe the reprieve can come back again. The initial reprieve was positive regarding how the U.S. might address tariffs, but that went to the wayside and hinted at some level of confusion.
Steel and Aluminum. Separate from other tariffs and were implemented globally. Demonstrated the administration was serious about tariffs.
Backing off on USMCA Compliant Goods. First autos and then all USMCA compliant goods were exempted from the Canada/Mexico tariffs. Seems like this could have been anticipated, which likely affects how countries come to the negotiating table.
The Liberation Day tariffs. Literally instant disbelief over the numbers presented. Reciprocal tariffs were anything but reciprocal. To the rest of the world, this looked like the U.S. had gone “off the deep end” on tariffs. (Even to many in the states).
The Liberation Day tariffs went into effect. More confusion for markets.
90-Day Reprieve and “Reciprocal” Tariffs of “only” 10%. What an amazing rally in the stock market. Suddenly 90 days to negotiate (which seems like it would have made sense from day 1). Also, while 10% is at the high side of overall tariffs between countries, it was at least in the ballpark. China was not given a break. It seemed like maybe the administration was reading the T-Reports, and this had pulled us back to the “somewhat reasonable” zone and clearly indicated that China was the main priority.
Some further exemptions on products, primarily tech. Another thing that made sense, though this looked like the U.S. was once again backing down on something they could have foreseen as an issue.
Then statements about how National Security and sectoral tariffs would pick up the slack here. Though it has been quiet since then.
Further restrictions on what chips can be sold to China. Hit some U.S. stocks, but further enforced the view that China is public enemy number 1.
How the tariffs have been rolled out and have evolved, I think is important.
The Foreign Mindset Coming Into Negotiations
As countries come to the negotiating table, I think this is a reasonable assessment of their state of mind.
Some confusion over why they were targeted and the amount they were targeted with.
Some trepidation about needing the U.S. market, but also about how much they can depend on any deal going forward.
At least somewhat encouraged by what they may see as a series of miscalculations where the administration had to back down because of damage done to our markets or economy.
The Art of the Deal is quite simple and easily understood. During Trump 1.0, few seemed to understand that. This time, many, particularly Xi, seem to understand that. Presumably, Trump knows that others know the art of the deal and they are adapting. Though, given how events have unfolded, I am not sure that the U.S. policy wasn’t dependent on getting the same reactions from world leaders as they received under Trump 1.0.
My view is that countries are coming in concerned about the economic impact on their country, but with the sense that mistakes have been made, and there is some lack of trust (i.e. deals are going to be viewed as a stopgap solution, giving them time to figure out longer-term solutions).
The Deals
Finally, we get to the main point. Are we going to get “rip your face off” rallies on the back of deals? Or will deals or the lack of deals drag markets (and the economy) lower?
Face-saving deal. Let’s for a moment assume the administration has had a “rethink” on tariff and trade policy. That they are hearing from so many businesses that the tariff policy as enacted is not helpful. That bringing manufacturing jobs back to America will take years (and would be better accomplished by focusing on domestic policy first, to get the ball rolling). The administration has clearly backed off, so, what would a face-saving deal look like?

	
Reduced tariffs on both sides. I’m 98% convinced this could have been achieved without taking many of the steps that have hurt the administration. The other countries, at this stage, are far more likely to understand both the tariff and non-tariff barriers they have in place and where to cave and where not to cave to get the best deal for themselves.
Commitments to buy American made goods – with a focus on defense and agriculture. No real teeth to enforce compliance.
Some commitment to not allowing China to use them to change “country of origin” designations. It’s a bit tricky, but not a big deal.

	
My estimate for this type of deal being offered by the U.S. to most countries has jumped from about 20% likely to 70% likely (given recent news flow and actions around tariffs).
The administration can claim a win, and anyone trying to point out that these results could have been achieved without damaging the U.S. reputation, will be shouted down in social media. The end state will be a similar economy to what we had before. Tariffs were only a portion of the problem, and a minor one at that. Countries won’t increase their actual purchases of U.S. goods for long. They will take the lull to figure out ways to be less dependent on the U.S. So, markets may rally on the first deal headline or two, but fade as markets will establish that the U.S. economy and U.S. corporations are in a worse spot after these deals than before this whole thing started.
Real Trade Balance Deals. If the side that has advocated for bringing production home wins, then the U.S. will need deals like this:
	
Commitment to buy American made goods, with hard figures and punishments for failing to comply. A real effort to ramp up sales of American made goods. Countries commit to buying from America and face punishment (presumably high tariffs) for failing to comply. This might be difficult for many countries to agree to.
Restrictions on business with China. At the very least, countries will be forced to acknowledge that China can not use them as a conduit to change country of origination. The U.S. may try to get other countries to tariff China (which would make U.S. imports look cheap relative to China). Some willingness to combat China’s worst offenses is likely palatable, but countries will be careful about being too aggressive against China, given China’s size, and in some cases, its proximity. Also, given the erratic nature of U.S. trade policy since the inauguration, countries have to be more hesitant to be perceived as anti-China than before the policies were launched.
Tariffs as a mix of revenue, punishment, and wins. Tariffs drop in importance if the true aim is to get trade balances in line.
It would be nice if the two things that I think are missing from the tariff math are incorporated into the administration’s view, as the starting point would be much closer than it is currently being viewed.


Let’s assume this approach is now only used 30% of the time. I think this approach has a very low success rate. Countries, for a variety of reasons, are likely to resist this. As time goes on, if we don’t get deals, the market will sense that the U.S. has over-reached and will have to price in more economic problems and lower corporate profits. If the U.S. gets deals of this nature, it would be a big and actual win.
The Path of Negotiations and Deals
My base case is that the U.S. likely started down the “Real Trade Balance Deals” path and that is why we are hearing so little from other countries. They are potentially left confused or even flabbergasted by U.S. demands and are not in a rush to sign that type of deal.
Maybe some countries cave and sign that type of deal, bringing more countries to that type of deal.
But if we go weeks without deals, or worse, leaks that countries are far apart, look for the negotiating strategy to shift to “Face Saving Deals” (if it hasn’t already).
I could be wrong on how I read the “cards” at the table, but that is my best estimate of who is holding what. I think the biggest risk for markets and the economy, is that one side thinks their cards are far better than they are (and from what I’ve seen so far, that risk seems to be more likely on the American side). That would mean the problems in the global economy would mount and the risk of a deep recession would grow.
Damage to the American Brand
If the entire world lets bygones be bygones, we can get back to roughly where we were before. 
I just don’t see that.
I think there will be an extended period where American stocks, bonds, and products suffer from the geopolitical and economic actions taken.
I would love to be wrong here, but I don’t think I am. Especially since even if deals are signed, the news flow, economically, geopolitically, and domestically will certainly highlight divisiveness that doesn’t help heal any wounds that have been created.
Bottom Line
I think the volatility and “beta” to any given headline has been reduced.
I think this is a path back to where we all thought we were headed – growth fueled by business-friendly strategies. Taking actions to spur the development of domestic industries, with an emphasis on issues linked to National Security. The extraction and PROCESSING of commodities, especially those that are energy-related, or crucial to future tech. Chips. A more domestic-focused policy can achieve the goals over time, and have a narrower range of outcomes (that are more predictable than trying to rebalance global trade relationships, that took years to form, in a matter of months).
A pivot is required, and we might get it.
I would be pleasantly surprised to see some very strong trade deals announced, but my base case is that we realize that this approach isn’t working, and we wind up getting some face-saving deals.
The economy is slowing, and I think that will become more evident in the coming weeks (unless I’m surprised on the “big trade deal” front).
The U.S., as an investment choice, a tourist destination, or a brand more broadly, is going to act to slow the economy and markets.
That should be good for rates, but all the hope about deficit reduction seems to be diminishing. Much of what I think would be required to make a pivot successful will involve spending.
I think that keeps bonds in a range (maybe a wide range of 4.1% to 4.5% on 10s) but a range, nonetheless. At the moment, the risk of breaking out of this range is to the higher yield side. I see more headline risk to bonds than optimism, especially on the deficit side of the equation.
Equities will suffer, in dribs and drabs, if the U.S. doesn’t back down on what we hope to achieve in trade negotiations.
To me, it comes down to undoing a lot on the trade front and pivoting sharply to doing what is in primarily U.S. control.
The rate at which announcements shaping the geopolitical environment, the economic environment, and the investing landscape is staggering.
Hope you have been able to use the long weekend to regroup and get ready for more! And hopefully it is Dealpalooza time – we could all use that!

A Daily Caller News Foundation investigation has potentially uncovered why the far-left mayor stands with illegal aliens and not with bolstering national security after the disastrous Biden-Harris regime&apos;s migrant invasion:
