      <title>Global trade outlook is deteriorating:

The World Trade Organization expects world merchandise trade to fall -0.2% in 2025, down from +2.7% growth expected at the beginning of the year.

This would follow the +2.9% growth recorded in 2024.

North American trade is set to be hit the hardest, while Asia and Europe will continue to see modest growth.

The WTO also highlights that if the US imposes higher reciprocal tariffs after a 90-day pause, global merchandise trade could drop by -1.5% this year.

For 2026, the WTO forecasts +2.5% growth, down from the previously expected +2.9%.

Global trade is experiencing a historic slowdown. (From TKL)</title>

      <title>OPTIONS TRADERS POSITIONED FOR MORE WILD STOCK SWINGS

     Investors are bracing for more stock market volatility ahead.
     Options traders are betting on a move of 1% or more, higher or lower, in the S&amp;P 500 for every session through at least May 23, according to a Monday note from Citigroup strategists.
     Those moves are expected to be higher on days of economic importance: Options are pricing in a swing of 1.8% in the benchmark index when the April jobs report is released, and a move of 1.7% the day of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell&apos;s post-meeting press conference in May.

      <title>GOLDMAN SACHS LOWERS 1Q GDP ESTIMATE 

Goldman Sachs economists now think that the economy grew at a 0.1% annualized pace in the three months through March, down from 0.4% previously. New home sales grew by more than expected last month, but the construction deflator declined by less than Goldman expected, denting the read-through to inflation-adjusted growth. The first official estimate of 1Q GDP from the Commerce Department lands April 30. (From Walter Bloomberg)</title>

      <title>TRADE, MIGRATION CONCERNS DENT U.S. TOURISM: JPMORGAN

Anti-U.S. sentiment over trade policy and fears of the immigration crackdown overreaching are already hurting tourism from overseas. After an adjustment for calendar timing, Easter travel to the U.S. is looking about 10% worse than last year&apos;s level, JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli writes. As a rough estimate, a 10% decline in foreign travel would subtract about 0.1% from GDP in 2025, Feroli concludes. The hit, of course, would be especially apparent in the hotels and restaurants sector, although foreigners are also important customers for educational institutions. In the past, when anti-U.S. sentiment has driven declines in tourism, such as at the start of the 2003 Iraq war, the tourism weakness has been sharp but short-lived. (From Walter Bloomberg)</title>

      <title>And, we are back:

The S&amp;P 500 is now down -100 points from its high of the day as Bessent says Trump has not offered to take down tariffs on China on a unilateral basis.

Bessent has also declined to comment on a WSJ report that claimed tariffs would fall from 145% to 50%-65%.

More conflicting headlines are likely coming next. (From TKL)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 6) To be clear: all these housing markets still have some issues. Particularly, outbound migration. They all lost people during pandemic, and still might be losing some people today.

But in terms of fundamentals (home prices to income, and to rent) they are well-priced. And historically affordable.

Indicating we could be seeing a renaissance for the legacy big city housing markets the next 5 years. Especially if return to office mandates keep happening. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 5) I think this next one is my favorite, though. Cook County in Chicago.

In the last bubble, prices were trading at 5.2x incomes in Chicago.

Then there was a correction. And since then, values have kept pace with incomes, and today&apos;s 3.7x multiple is one of the cheapest in the country for a major city. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 2) The average 20-year home price/income ratio in Manhattan is 14.4.

Meaning homes/condos typically trade for 14x median income.

Yet today, they&apos;re trading for 10.8x median income.

The lowest multiple in decades. Indicating that the market is undervalued. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 1) DC might be an exception given how the federal workforce is getting cut.

But in general, home values in these areas are trading at very reasonable levels compared to incomes.

      <title>Here are the counties in America that are &quot;undervalued&quot; in terms of home prices to income.

Manhattan - 25% undervalued
Bronx - 22%
DC - 18%
New Orelans - 11%
San Francisco- 11%
Queens - 5%
Brooklyn - 4%
Chicago - 3%
Boston - 2%

All legacy, big city housing markets for most part. They struggled during pandemic and lost people. But now they could be in for a turn-around.

Real estate is the cheapest it&apos;s been in these areas in decades. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>
