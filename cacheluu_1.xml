      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 6) To be clear: all these housing markets still have some issues. Particularly, outbound migration. They all lost people during pandemic, and still might be losing some people today.

But in terms of fundamentals (home prices to income, and to rent) they are well-priced. And historically affordable.

Indicating we could be seeing a renaissance for the legacy big city housing markets the next 5 years. Especially if return to office mandates keep happening. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 5) I think this next one is my favorite, though. Cook County in Chicago.

In the last bubble, prices were trading at 5.2x incomes in Chicago.

Then there was a correction. And since then, values have kept pace with incomes, and today&apos;s 3.7x multiple is one of the cheapest in the country for a major city. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 4) Here&apos;s another example: Suffolk County, MA (Boston).

The Home/Value income ratio in Boston is 7.6x. today. Which is a hair below it&apos;s long-term 20-year average.

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 2) The average 20-year home price/income ratio in Manhattan is 14.4.

Meaning homes/condos typically trade for 14x median income.

Yet today, they&apos;re trading for 10.8x median income.

The lowest multiple in decades. Indicating that the market is undervalued. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>Here are the counties in America that are &quot;undervalued&quot; in terms of home prices to income.

Manhattan - 25% undervalued
Bronx - 22%
DC - 18%
New Orelans - 11%
San Francisco- 11%
Queens - 5%
Brooklyn - 4%
Chicago - 3%
Boston - 2%

All legacy, big city housing markets for most part. They struggled during pandemic and lost people. But now they could be in for a turn-around.

Real estate is the cheapest it&apos;s been in these areas in decades. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>🚨 TRUMP MAY CUT CHINA TARIFFS TO EASE TENSIONS

The Trump administration is weighing major tariff cuts on Chinese imports—possibly by over 50%—to reduce trade tensions, sources say. No final decision has been made, and options remain open.

One idea is a tiered system:

🔸 35% tariffs on non-strategic items

🔸 100%+ tariffs on goods tied to national security

🔸 Phased in over five years

Trump confirmed Tuesday that his 145% tariffs could be reduced but “won’t be zero.” Markets reacted positively to the news.

China responded by signaling openness to talks but warned it won’t negotiate under U.S. threats. Some in Beijing see Trump’s shift as backing down. (From Walter Bloomberg)</title>
