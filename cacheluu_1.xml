      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Houthis Claim Attacks On Two US Aircraft Carrier Groups Off Yemen&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon has not confirmed that US warships have come under attack. But the US side has tended to remain silent in the face of similar recent reports by the Houthis. However, Washington has in the recent past acknowledged Houthi efforts to target its warships with drones and missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea cited American support for Israel as it &quot;oppresses the Palestinian people&quot;. Describing the fresh attacks, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://efe.com/en/latest-news/2025-04-21/houthis-claim-attacks-on-israel-us-aircraft-carriers-in-red-sea/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The first targeted a vital Israeli enemy target in the occupied Ashkelon area using a Yaffa drone, while the second targeted an Israeli military target in the Umm al-Rashrash area in southern occupied Palestine using a Sammad-1 drone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then announced two military operations against the US in &quot;&lt;strong&gt;retaliation to the American aggression against our country&lt;/strong&gt; and its massacres against our people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Missile forces and drone units &lt;strong&gt;launched two cruise missiles and two drones at the USS Harry S. Truman &lt;/strong&gt;aircraft carrier and its associated ships in the northern part of the Red Sea. The second operation, carried out by naval forces, missile troops and drone units, &lt;strong&gt;targeted the USS Carl Vinson&lt;/strong&gt; and its associated ships in the Arabian Sea, using three cruise missiles and four drones,&quot; Sarea told the &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.masirahtv.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Al Masirah&lt;/a&gt; TV channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saria then claimed that &quot;the goals of both military operations were successfully accomplished.&quot; But there are as yet no signs the carriers were actually hit by any inbound fire. The Houthis actually made a similar claim of attacks on both US carriers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/us-aircraft-carrier-houthis-iran-war-2061468&quot;&gt;on April 18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just about a week ago the USS Harry S. Truman was joined by the USS Carl Vinson in regional Mideast waters. Presumably this is a sign the Trump administration plans to ramp of its airstrikes on Yemen even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Houthis have &lt;strong&gt;proven impossible to dislodge merely through airstrikes&lt;/strong&gt;, which have been intense and ongoing since March 15. There have been recent reports that the United States is in talks with Saudi-supported Yemeni forces in exile (who have long fought the Houthi rebels) to cobble together a possible new land offensive to send against the Shia militant group which is allied to Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Houthis Claim Attacks On Two US Aircraft Carrier Groups Off Yemen

            
Yemen&apos;s Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for attacks on two US aircraft carrier groups currently patrolling the Red Sea and areas off Yemen&apos;s coast on Monday, and further announced fresh drone launches on the southern Israeli cities of Ashkelon and Eilat.
The Pentagon has not confirmed that US warships have come under attack. But the US side has tended to remain silent in the face of similar recent reports by the Houthis. However, Washington has in the recent past acknowledged Houthi efforts to target its warships with drones and missiles.

&quot;Yemeni forces opposed to the Houthis are in talks with the US and Gulf Arab allies about a possible land offensive to oust the militant group from the Red Sea coast, according to people involved in the discussions,&quot; Bloomberg wrote last week.
Even if the US commits itself to a &apos;limited&apos; ground operation using proxies, there&apos;s always the potential for serious escalation which leads to direct Pentagon boots on the ground. The whole Yemen campaign seems a &apos;no win&apos; situation, and is ultimately to the greater benefit of Israel - and not necessarily Washington.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Is Europe Still Fighting Lost Energy Wars?&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/21523/eu-greenpeace-dakota-access-pipeline&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Drieu Godefridi via The Gatestone Institute,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news came down like a thunderbolt. &lt;strong&gt;In a spectacular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/03/19/greenpeace-dakota-access-pipeline-energy-transfer/&quot;&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt;, the Morton County courthouse in Mandan, North Dakota, ordered the environmentalist organizations that comprise Greenpeace to pay $665 million in damages to Energy Transfer, the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. &lt;/strong&gt;The figure appears a monumental slap in the face to Greenpeace, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/greenpeace-dakota-access-pipeline-lawsuit-verdict-5036944c1d2e7d3d7b704437e8110fbb&quot;&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; by Energy Transfer for &quot;defamation, trespass, nuisance, civil conspiracy and other acts,&quot; following demonstrations against the pipeline project in 2016 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/5335.jpg?itok=QHWTx3c2&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/5335.jpg?itok=QHWTx3c2&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;d0cf5ccd-90af-4b2f-97ea-0514e15fa699&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/5335.jpg?itok=QHWTx3c2&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Dakota jury did not pull any punches. Greenpeace was declared &lt;a href=&quot;https://northdakotamonitor.com/2025/03/19/jury-finds-greenpeace-at-fault-for-protest-damages-awards-pipeline-developer-hundreds-of-millions/&quot;&gt;liable&lt;/a&gt;; its methods illegal and its actions harmful. Greenpeace has already announced that it will appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the legal wrangling, this ruling raises the question: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what if this case marks the start of a major transatlantic rift between an America defending its energy interests and a Europe mired in its green romanticism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us look at the facts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dakota Access Pipeline -- a nearly 1,900-kilometer artery that carries crude oil from North Dakota&apos;s Bakken shale formation to Patoka, Illinois -- has been the focus of much passion. As early as 2016, Sioux and Cheyenne Indian tribes, supported by an armada of activists, celebrities and organizations including Greenpeace, denounced the project as threatening sacred tribal lands as well as water resources. Tens of thousands of signatures poured in on petitions, and protests at the construction sites paralyzed the work -- all costing Energy Transfer some $300 million in delays and extra costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anger often degenerated into outright &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/21523/Tens%20of%20thousands%20of%20petition%20signatures%20poured%20in%20and%20demonstrations%20paralysed%20the%20work,%20costing%20Energy%20Transfer%20some%20300%20million%20dollars%20in%20delays%20and%20extra%20costs.&quot;&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt; and large-scale vandalism, much to the annoyance of local populations, who became fed up with these crusaders who had appeared from elsewhere. Faced with this chaos, President Donald J. Trump, freshly inaugurated in 2017, issued a presidential &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-201700067/pdf/DCPD-201700067.pdf&quot;&gt;memorandum&lt;/a&gt; to speed up the project, while brushing aside what he called an &quot;incredibly cumbersome and horrific authorization process.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pipeline became operational in May 2017. Energy Transfer nevertheless immediately decided to go on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/case-documents/2019/20190221_docket-30-2019-0V-00180_complaint.pdf&quot;&gt;legal offensive&lt;/a&gt;. According to Energy Transfer, Greenpeace had orchestrated the demonstrations, financed the disorder and spread lies about the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jury in Mandan, North Dakota, agreed on March 19, 2025, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/greenpeace-lawsuit-energy-transfer-dakota-pipeline&quot;&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that Greenpeace International, Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace Fund Inc. must pay combined damages of $665 million to Energy Transfer,&lt;strong&gt; a sum that sounds like a declaration of war on environmentalist NGOs. The days of omnipotence and de facto impunity for environmentalist NGOs were over.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace USA is now crying that it will be forced into bankruptcy. Really? With its network of donors -- small, large and mega-large -- the NGO should be able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlantico.fr/article/decryptage/la-justice-americaine-condamne-tres-lourdement-greenpeace-et-voila-pourquoi-cela-pourrait-devenir-un-point-de-tension-entre-l-europe-et-les-etats-unis-amende-environnement-energy-transfer-condamnation-Samuel-Furfari&quot;&gt;bounce&lt;/a&gt; back. &lt;strong&gt;The signal is clear: in the United States, no one any longer jokes with those who hinder the economy and trample on the rights of others under the guise of idealism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile, Europe is getting restless.&lt;/strong&gt; Greenpeace International has invoked the European anti-SLAPP &lt;a href=&quot;https://eucrim.eu/news/anti-slapp-directive-published/#:~:text=The%20%22Anti%2DSLAPP%20Directive%22,their%20engagement%20in%20public%20participation.&quot;&gt;directive&lt;/a&gt; -- an EU initiative to protect individuals, especially journalists and activists, from abusive lawsuits (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) aimed at silencing criticism or public participation, by providing safeguards like early dismissal of unfounded claims and financial protections. The anti-SLAPP directive, adopted in April 2024 by a European Union always ready to support and finance the most extremist NGOs, concretely aims to immunize these organizations against legal proceedings. Greenpeace International filed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/72706/greenpeace-international-files-lawsuit-against-energy-transfer-in-first-use-of-eu-anti-slapp-directive/&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Energy Transfer under the anti-SLAPP directive in the Netherlands, in February 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/72706/greenpeace-international-files-lawsuit-against-energy-transfer-in-first-use-of-eu-anti-slapp-directive/#:~:text=Based%20in%20the%20Netherlands%2C%20Greenpeace,Directive%2C%20along%20with%20existing%20Dutch&quot;&gt;related&lt;/a&gt; the incident to broader environmental concerns, according to its statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Based in the Netherlands, Greenpeace International is citing Dutch law on torts and abuse of rights, as well as Chapter V of the EU Directive, adopted in 2024, which protects organisations based in the EU against SLAPPs outside the EU, and entitles them to compensation. The Directive, along with existing Dutch law, paves the way for GPI to pursue remedies against three entities in ET&apos;s corporate group... for the damage it has suffered and continues to suffer as a result of the SLAPP suits and related actions in the US. Greenpeace International sent Energy Transfer a Notice of Liability in July 2024, summoning it to withdraw its lawsuit in North Dakota and pay damages, or face legal action. Energy Transfer refused to do so.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenpeace would apparently like organizations such as itself to directly or indirectly cause hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage, while preventing any court from intervening.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The applicability of the EU anti-SLAPP directive to the judgment in question is doubtful, because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The anti-SLAPP directive in question has not yet entered into force in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It is first and foremost Greenpeace USA that has been found liable (for $400 million) for acts committed in the USA, while the EU&apos;s anti-SLAPP directive is solely related to cross-border disputes. According to Article 1 of the anti-SLAPP directive, it pertains to clearly baseless claims or exploitative legal actions in civil cases that have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/blog/2025/02/anti-slapp-directive-roadmap-slapp-targets-and-obstacles-along-way&quot;&gt;cross-border&lt;/a&gt; elements, targeting individuals or entities — known as SLAPP targets — due to their involvement in public participation. The requirement of &apos;cross-border implications&apos; means that SLAPPs related solely to domestic cases are not covered by the directive.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace was found liable for activities that led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/03/20/greenpeace-ordered-to-pay-667m-in-protest-damages-over-dakota-access-pipeline/&quot;&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt;, not for having expressed its opinion. Incitement to violence is not an opinion, and the EU anti-SLAPP directive does not cover acts of violence. Its primary focus is on protecting individuals and entities engaged in public participation from manifestly unfounded claims or abusive court proceedings in civil or commercial matters with cross-border implications.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If judges in the Netherlands nevertheless find in favor of Greenpeace International, anything is possible: such a ruling would be another slap(p) in the face to the United States. Would the Trump administration let stand a new European encroachment on US sovereignty? It looks as if the EU, through this directive, once again is trying to dictate the law on American soil. Transatlantic tensions, already fuelled by trade disputes, issues of free speech, NATO funding and the war in Ukraine, would mount further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond this legal duel, there is a clash of civilizations at play. &lt;/strong&gt;On one side, Trump&apos;s America, driven by the mantra &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Drill%2C+Baby%2C+Drill&amp;oq=Drill%2C+Baby%2C+Drill&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg90gEHMTA1ajBqNKgCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:7da37395,vid:xSfg0qTBCHQ,st:0&quot;&gt;drill, baby, drill&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and a newfound pride in fossil fuels. Shale oil and gas, abundant and cheap, have made America the world&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=36292#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20has%20been,U.S.%20production%20exceeded%20Saudi%20Arabia&apos;s.&quot;&gt;leading&lt;/a&gt; producer of hydrocarbons. The US is seeing energy independence boosted by massive exports of liquefied natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, a Europe stubbornly pursuing its &lt;a href=&quot;https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en&quot;&gt;Green Deal&lt;/a&gt;, a project as costly as it is illusory, sacrificing its competitiveness on the altar of environmentalist dogma. While in Europe, factories are closing, they are reopening in the United States. The contrast between pragmatism and ideology is striking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we learn from all this? &lt;strong&gt;America has chosen its side: energy sovereignty, prosperity, an end to impunity for NGOs that engage in illegal activities. Greenpeace may appeal and its activists may cry &quot;gagging prosecution,&quot; but the tide clearly seems to be turning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Is Europe Still Fighting Lost Energy Wars?

            
Authored by Drieu Godefridi via The Gatestone Institute,
The news came down like a thunderbolt. In a spectacular decision, the Morton County courthouse in Mandan, North Dakota, ordered the environmentalist organizations that comprise Greenpeace to pay $665 million in damages to Energy Transfer, the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. The figure appears a monumental slap in the face to Greenpeace, which was sued by Energy Transfer for &quot;defamation, trespass, nuisance, civil conspiracy and other acts,&quot; following demonstrations against the pipeline project in 2016 and 2017.



The North Dakota jury did not pull any punches. Greenpeace was declared liable; its methods illegal and its actions harmful. Greenpeace has already announced that it will appeal.
Beyond the legal wrangling, this ruling raises the question: what if this case marks the start of a major transatlantic rift between an America defending its energy interests and a Europe mired in its green romanticism?
Let us look at the facts. 
The Dakota Access Pipeline -- a nearly 1,900-kilometer artery that carries crude oil from North Dakota&apos;s Bakken shale formation to Patoka, Illinois -- has been the focus of much passion. As early as 2016, Sioux and Cheyenne Indian tribes, supported by an armada of activists, celebrities and organizations including Greenpeace, denounced the project as threatening sacred tribal lands as well as water resources.

The anger often degenerated into outright violence and large-scale vandalism, much to the annoyance of local populations, who became fed up with these crusaders who had appeared from elsewhere. Faced with this chaos, President Donald J. Trump, freshly inaugurated in 2017, issued a presidential memorandum to speed up the project, while brushing aside what he called an &quot;incredibly cumbersome and horrific authorization process.&quot;
The pipeline became operational in May 2017. Energy Transfer nevertheless immediately decided to go on a legal offensive. According to Energy Transfer, Greenpeace had orchestrated the demonstrations, financed the disorder and spread lies about the pipeline.
The jury in Mandan, North Dakota, agreed on March 19, 2025, and ruled that Greenpeace International, Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace Fund Inc. must pay combined damages of $665 million to Energy Transfer, a sum that sounds like a declaration of war on environmentalist NGOs. The days of omnipotence and de facto impunity for environmentalist NGOs were over.
Greenpeace USA is now crying that it will be forced into bankruptcy. Really? With its network of donors -- small, large and mega-large -- the NGO should be able to bounce back. The signal is clear: in the United States, no one any longer jokes with those who hinder the economy and trample on the rights of others under the guise of idealism.
Meanwhile, Europe is getting restless. Greenpeace International has invoked the European anti-SLAPP directive -- an EU initiative to protect individuals, especially journalists and activists, from abusive lawsuits (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) aimed at silencing criticism or public participation, by providing safeguards like early dismissal of unfounded claims and financial protections. The anti-SLAPP directive, adopted in April 2024 by a European Union always ready to support and finance the most extremist NGOs, concretely aims to immunize these organizations against legal proceedings. Greenpeace International filed a lawsuit against Energy Transfer under the anti-SLAPP directive in the Netherlands, in February 2025.
Greenpeace related the incident to broader environmental concerns, according to its statement:
&quot;Based in the Netherlands, Greenpeace International is citing Dutch law on torts and abuse of rights, as well as Chapter V of the EU Directive, adopted in 2024, which protects organisations based in the EU against SLAPPs outside the EU, and entitles them to compensation. The Directive, along with existing Dutch law, paves the way for GPI to pursue remedies against three entities in ET&apos;s corporate group... for the damage it has suffered and continues to suffer as a result of the SLAPP suits and related actions in the US. Greenpeace International sent Energy Transfer a Notice of Liability in July 2024, summoning it to withdraw its lawsuit in North Dakota and pay damages, or face legal action. Energy Transfer refused to do so.&quot;
Greenpeace would apparently like organizations such as itself to directly or indirectly cause hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage, while preventing any court from intervening.
The applicability of the EU anti-SLAPP directive to the judgment in question is doubtful, because:

	
The anti-SLAPP directive in question has not yet entered into force in the Netherlands.
It is first and foremost Greenpeace USA that has been found liable (for $400 million) for acts committed in the USA, while the EU&apos;s anti-SLAPP directive is solely related to cross-border disputes. According to Article 1 of the anti-SLAPP directive, it pertains to clearly baseless claims or exploitative legal actions in civil cases that have cross-border elements, targeting individuals or entities — known as SLAPP targets — due to their involvement in public participation. The requirement of &apos;cross-border implications&apos; means that SLAPPs related solely to domestic cases are not covered by the directive.
Greenpeace was found liable for activities that led to violence, not for having expressed its opinion. Incitement to violence is not an opinion, and the EU anti-SLAPP directive does not cover acts of violence. Its primary focus is on protecting individuals and entities engaged in public participation from manifestly unfounded claims or abusive court proceedings in civil or commercial matters with cross-border implications.
If judges in the Netherlands nevertheless find in favor of Greenpeace International, anything is possible: such a ruling would be another slap(p) in the face to the United States. Would the Trump administration let stand a new European encroachment on US sovereignty? It looks as if the EU, through this directive, once again is trying to dictate the law on American soil. Transatlantic tensions, already fuelled by trade disputes, issues of free speech, NATO funding and the war in Ukraine, would mount further.
Beyond this legal duel, there is a clash of civilizations at play. On one side, Trump&apos;s America, driven by the mantra &quot;drill, baby, drill&quot; and a newfound pride in fossil fuels. Shale oil and gas, abundant and cheap, have made America the world&apos;s leading producer of hydrocarbons. The US is seeing energy independence boosted by massive exports of liquefied natural gas.
On the other side, a Europe stubbornly pursuing its Green Deal, a project as costly as it is illusory, sacrificing its competitiveness on the altar of environmentalist dogma. While in Europe, factories are closing, they are reopening in the United States. The contrast between pragmatism and ideology is striking.
What can we learn from all this? America has chosen its side: energy sovereignty, prosperity, an end to impunity for NGOs that engage in illegal activities. Greenpeace may appeal and its activists may cry &quot;gagging prosecution,&quot; but the tide clearly seems to be turning.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is a new boom in deceptive trading practices taking shape in many parts of the world? &lt;/strong&gt;As the U.S.–China trade war intensifies, it certainly looks that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202025-04-21T124931.747.jpg?itok=ErxUs8Zn&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202025-04-21T124931.747.jpg?itok=ErxUs8Zn&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;4ae57fff-0484-4bdf-b7dc-2245e159af17&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20-%202025-04-21T124931.747.jpg?itok=ErxUs8Zn&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;China’s Gray Trade Strategy Blunts Impact of US Tariffs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With U.S. tariffs reaching 145 percent on Chinese imports—at least at the time of this writing—Beijing’s new strategy seems to include the use of so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caixinglobal.com/2025-04-14/chinese-exporters-look-to-go-gray-to-circumvent-trump-tariffs-102309377.html&quot;&gt;gray trade&lt;/a&gt; to bypass American trade barriers. Gray trade involves rerouting goods through low-tariff countries, such as Vietnam, Mexico, or Malaysia, to conceal their Chinese origin and thereby reduce U.S. import duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This sneaky tactic has surged as a response to President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff policies, making China’s goods less competitive in the U.S. market due to their added cost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gray Trade Loophole Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The simple idea behind gray trade is to exploit loopholes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trade.gov/identify-and-apply-rules-origin&quot;&gt;U.S. Rules of Origin&lt;/a&gt;, the trading guidance for determining a product’s country of origin for tariff purposes. &lt;/strong&gt;Chinese goods, for example, will remain unassembled or may be about 90 percent manufactured before being shipped to an intermediary country. There, they undergo final production, assembly, processing, repackaging, or relabeling to qualify as originating from that country, rather than from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Chinese electronic parts may be sent to Vietnam, assembled into a product, and then labeled, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/facing-trump-tariffs-vietnam-eyes-crackdown-some-china-trade-2025-04-11/&quot;&gt;Made in Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;.” This enables China to benefit from the 10 percent tariff on Vietnamese imports under Trump’s 2025 reciprocal tariff regime, instead of the 145 percent tariffs on Chinese goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a perfectly sensible response by Beijing, and there’s no doubt that Chinese firms are rerouting goods through Vietnam, Mexico, and Turkey to exploit lower tariffs on goods sourced from those countries. &lt;/strong&gt;A related tactic occurring in Mexico involves dividing goods into packages that are below the $800 tariff-free threshold for non-Chinese origins, a tactic called the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/06/27/how-chinese-goods-dodge-american-tariffs&quot;&gt;Tijuana two-step&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;China Has to Resort to Gray Trade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But gray trade isn’t new or even unfamiliar to the second Trump administration. During Trump’s first term, Chinese solar manufacturers bypassed 30 percent tariffs by partnering with their neighbors in Southeast Asia. In 2025, &lt;a href=&quot;https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/China-Uses-Gray-Trade-Tactics-To-Circumvent-US-Tariffs.html&quot;&gt;tracing&lt;/a&gt; the movement and provenance of vast numbers of products is complex at best and nearly impossible at worst, making it a challenge to disrupt gray trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no mystery why Beijing is engaging in gray trade. With its exports to the United States accounting for 10 percent of its trade and supporting between 10 million and 20 million jobs, some experts say the world’s largest manufacturer faces an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/how-chinas-exporters-are-scrambling-to-mitigate-the-impact-of-punishing-us-tariffs-.html&quot;&gt;80 percent&lt;/a&gt; decline in its exports over the next two years, if the gray trade were to cease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As domestic economic conditions decline due to the anticipated extensive trade tensions, China’s 2025 GDP projections have fallen from 5 percent to as low as 4 percent, potentially resulting in a 20 percent drop in GDP growth in just one year. With joblessness among its young people (ages 16 to 24) already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-youth-jobless-rate-rises-169-february-2025-03-20/#:~:text=BEIJING%2C%20March%2020%20(Reuters),official%20data%20showed%20on%20Thursday.&quot;&gt;approaching 17 percent&lt;/a&gt;, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) faces a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thediplomat.com/2025/01/chinas-internal-struggles-the-rising-violence-that-could-lead-to-foreign-aggression/&quot;&gt;growing resentment&lt;/a&gt; among its people. The Party would like to avoid an uprising by its younger generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The gray trade has provided a much-needed cushion against the blow of the Trump administration’s high tariffs. &lt;/strong&gt;For instance, according to official data, China’s exports surged by 12.4 percent in March, with exports to ASEAN increasing by 11.6 percent and exports to Vietnam climbing by nearly 19 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Low-Tariff Countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just China that gains from gray trade. Its low-tariff country partners also gain economically from gray trade but face risks, too. Gray trading partners, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and Mexico, profit from trade and processing fees, with some estimates on the social media platform X reaching as high as 10 percent. It’s worth noting that between 2017 and 2022, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/24-072_269c46d6-2410-40b0-b680-348c488c6730.pdf&quot;&gt;Vietnam replaced&lt;/a&gt; almost half of China’s lost market share in U.S. imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, gray trading partner countries risk the consequences of U.S. pushback, resulting in a delicate balancing act for these countries caught between gray trade with China and managing important trading relationships with the United States.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Economic and Geopolitical Implications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economically, gray trade preserves China’s U.S. market access for the moment, but it raises costs as intermediaries take their cut, with logistics costs also increasing. For U.S. consumers, it may delay steep price hikes, but won’t eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geopolitically, Beijing’s retaliatory 125 percent tariffs on U.S. goods, plus adding barriers to U.S. beef and LNG imports, raise tensions even higher. &lt;strong&gt;CCP leader Xi Jinping’s recent visits to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia could have secured their gray trade hubs going forward.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Rough Road Ahead?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the impact of gray trade is perhaps deeper and wider than many may expect.&lt;/strong&gt; On the one hand, it’s a reasonable response on China’s part to U.S. tariffs. But on the other hand, there are greater risks. The United States could expand tariffs or use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/tariffs-using-emergency-economic-powers-risk-undermining-us-economic-security&quot;&gt;IEEPA&lt;/a&gt;) to close loopholes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, too, may be a rational response by the United States, or it could make things worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The global trade system for the past ninety years is collapsing, leaving it difficult for people to forecast the economic impact and tell where the bottom for a market is,” Vincent Chan, a China strategist at Aletheia Capital Ltd., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/chinese-stocks-plunge-amid-growing-fear-of-full-blown-trade-war#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20global%20trade%20system%20for,strategist%20at%20Aletheia%20Capital%20Ltd.&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As new phases of U.S. trade policy and responses unfold, the biggest risk may be uncontrolled escalation in both tariff retaliation and other forms of retaliation.&lt;/strong&gt; In short, the impact of the gray trade may be deeper and wider than many expect, and it could even lead to a global trade war, with its own far-reaching implications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Exposing Beijing&apos;s &apos;Gray Trade&apos; Tariff Avoidance Scheme

            
Authored by James Gorrie via The Epoch Times,
Is a new boom in deceptive trading practices taking shape in many parts of the world? As the U.S.–China trade war intensifies, it certainly looks that way.



China’s Gray Trade Strategy Blunts Impact of US Tariffs
With U.S. tariffs reaching 145 percent on Chinese imports—at least at the time of this writing—Beijing’s new strategy seems to include the use of so-called gray trade to bypass American trade barriers.

&lt;p&gt;Harmeet Dhillon’s decision to step down as the CEO of the Center of American Liberty to accept her new role as an assistant attorney general is one of mixed emotions, but it’s the right move, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/id5844789-EpochImages-1388585528-xl-6.jpg?itok=M2_v-iAe&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/id5844789-EpochImages-1388585528-xl-6.jpg?itok=M2_v-iAe&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ff39ba78-635f-43cc-9bde-391e80bd6828&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;370&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/id5844789-EpochImages-1388585528-xl-6.jpg?itok=M2_v-iAe&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harmeet Dhillon attends the 2023 CAGOP convention in Anaheim, Calif., on Sept. 30, 2023. John Fredricks/The Epoch Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump chose Dhillon, who is known for championing parental rights, to lead the civil rights division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) under the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. She was confirmed on April 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Our priorities are the president’s priorities&lt;/strong&gt;,” Dhillon told The Epoch Times. “Y&lt;strong&gt;ou’re not going to see any sunlight between us and the White House on their policy prerogatives&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s executive orders that aim to protect women’s and girls’ rights in sports and target gender ideology, anti-Semitism, and “unconstitutional and discriminatory behavior at America’s top institutions of higher learning” indicate a few focal points for the civil rights division, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Those are our top civil rights priorities, &lt;/strong&gt;and I don’t think anyone will be surprised to learn that,” she said. “I’m pretty sure I was selected for this role because of the background in civil rights on a number of aligned issues that we have done at the Center for American Liberty ... as well as my private practice and the Dhillon Law Group.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOJ’s civil rights division is the nation’s primary defender of religious liberties, which are protected by the First Amendment and many federal statutes&lt;strong&gt;, “so you can expect that to be a priority of this administration,”&lt;/strong&gt; she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more than 400 attorneys, 600 employees in the DOJ’s civil rights division, and a heavy backlog of work, Dhillon said she’s getting up to speed on the division’s activities and beginning new investigations and initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Every few minutes, something different crosses my desk&lt;/strong&gt;,” she said, on her seventh day on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While people on social media are asking her to investigate a wide range of issues, Dhillon said it will take time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can’t put the cart before the horse. We have to do our investigations in due order,” she said. “As lawyers, we need to get our facts straight and go through a particular process before we file lawsuits, but I can assure you that the civil rights division under Bondi’s leadership, and under President Trump’s leadership is going to be extremely active on the issues that Americans care about.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those issues, she said, are the ones the president has spoken about on the campaign trail and in the Oval Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Once we get started with some of these lawsuits becoming public and investigations—having some teeth into them—I think people are going to see those results to a much greater degree than ever in a Republican administration&lt;/strong&gt;,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dhillon recently launched a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/AAGDhillon&quot;&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; on social media platform X, where people can follow her official government posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%281507%29_0.jpg?itok=jSIsSHKC&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%281507%29_0.jpg?itok=jSIsSHKC&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;cff7e187-90c1-43be-b5c8-aa09b76d4d1d&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%281507%29_0.jpg?itok=jSIsSHKC&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attorney General Pam Bondi speaks during a press briefing at the Department of Justice in Washington on Feb. 12, 2025. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;‘Bittersweet’ Sentiments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she accepted the nomination, she knew it would mean stepping down as CEO of the Center for American Liberty, which she founded in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s bittersweet,” she said. “I’m sad about moving on because it was a dream of mine,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she is confident in her colleague Mark Trammell’s ability to take the reins. Trammell is the former executive director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dhillon said she started the organization because she saw conservative organizations “doing little slices of civil rights work in very narrow areas, but nobody comprehensively taking on the rights of American citizens who are suffering from novel forms of discrimination or traditional forms of discrimination.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The center has defended the rights of free speech for students on campus and filed more lawsuits during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, mainly on the grounds of religious freedom, than any other organization, and is well-known for representing young people who had undergone medical and hormonal treatments as teens in attempts to change their gender, which they are now trying to reverse; they’re known as detransitioners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have led the nation in standing up for the rights of young women to hold their physicians and medical institutions accountable for misleading them about the gender transition industry and the harm that it does to so many thousands of American young women and men as well,” Dhillon said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A New Role&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked if she would investigate complaints from parents of gender dysphoric children who say they’ve faced the threat of having a child taken from their custody for refusing to call the child by opposite sex or preferred pronouns, Dhillon said, “Center for American Liberty took on several cases like that and that should be a clue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I find it to be a very troubling trend,” she said. “It is absolutely a violation of Supreme Court jurisprudence, as well as natural law and civil rights law, for any state to usurp parental rights the way that we have seen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%281508%29_0.jpg?itok=0f9JFd2U&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%281508%29_0.jpg?itok=0f9JFd2U&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;c20c8164-3b20-4323-8f6f-2f581a814177&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%281508%29_0.jpg?itok=0f9JFd2U&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pins with gender pronouns in Laramie, Wyo., on Aug. 13, 2022.

&lt;p&gt;Coercing parents to use preferred pronouns as a condition of enjoying their natural rights as parents is a violation of the First Amendment, due process, and equal protection, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dhillon said she is also concerned about states that prohibit foster parents from helping orphaned children or troubled youth because they refuse to align with certain viewpoints on gender.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Dhillon Promises Action To Enforce Trump&apos;s Executive Orders On Civil Rights

            
Authored by Brad Jones via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
Harmeet Dhillon’s decision to step down as the CEO of the Center of American Liberty to accept her new role as an assistant attorney general is one of mixed emotions, but it’s the right move, she says.

President Donald Trump chose Dhillon, who is known for championing parental rights, to lead the civil rights division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) under the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. She was confirmed on April 3.
“Our priorities are the president’s priorities,” Dhillon told The Epoch Times. “You’re not going to see any sunlight between us and the White House on their policy prerogatives.”
Trump’s executive orders that aim to protect women’s and girls’ rights in sports and target gender ideology, anti-Semitism, and “unconstitutional and discriminatory behavior at America’s top institutions of higher learning” indicate a few focal points for the civil rights division, she said.
“Those are our top civil rights priorities, and I don’t think anyone will be surprised to learn that,” she said. “I’m pretty sure I was selected for this role because of the background in civil rights on a number of aligned issues that we have done at the Center for American Liberty ... as well as my private practice and the Dhillon Law Group.”
The DOJ’s civil rights division is the nation’s primary defender of religious liberties, which are protected by the First Amendment and many federal statutes, “so you can expect that to be a priority of this administration,” she said.
With more than 400 attorneys, 600 employees in the DOJ’s civil rights division, and a heavy backlog of work, Dhillon said she’s getting up to speed on the division’s activities and beginning new investigations and initiatives.
“Every few minutes, something different crosses my desk,” she said, on her seventh day on the job.
While people on social media are asking her to investigate a wide range of issues, Dhillon said it will take time.
“I can’t put the cart before the horse. We have to do our investigations in due order,” she said. “As lawyers, we need to get our facts straight and go through a particular process before we file lawsuits, but I can assure you that the civil rights division under Bondi’s leadership, and under President Trump’s leadership is going to be extremely active on the issues that Americans care about.”
And those issues, she said, are the ones the president has spoken about on the campaign trail and in the Oval Office.
“Once we get started with some of these lawsuits becoming public and investigations—having some teeth into them—I think people are going to see those results to a much greater degree than ever in a Republican administration,” she said.
Dhillon recently launched a new account on social media platform X, where people can follow her official government posts.

‘Bittersweet’ Sentiments
When she accepted the nomination, she knew it would mean stepping down as CEO of the Center for American Liberty, which she founded in 2018.
“It’s bittersweet,” she said. “I’m sad about moving on because it was a dream of mine,” she said.
But she is confident in her colleague Mark Trammell’s ability to take the reins. Trammell is the former executive director.
Dhillon said she started the organization because she saw conservative organizations “doing little slices of civil rights work in very narrow areas, but nobody comprehensively taking on the rights of American citizens who are suffering from novel forms of discrimination or traditional forms of discrimination.”
The center has defended the rights of free speech for students on campus and filed more lawsuits during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, mainly on the grounds of religious freedom, than any other organization, and is well-known for representing young people who had undergone medical and hormonal treatments as teens in attempts to change their gender, which they are now trying to reverse; they’re known as detransitioners.
“We have led the nation in standing up for the rights of young women to hold their physicians and medical institutions accountable for misleading them about the gender transition industry and the harm that it does to so many thousands of American young women and men as well,” Dhillon said.

      <title>Manhattan Congestion Toll Remains In Effect Despite Trump Admin Deadline For Removal</title>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Manhattan Congestion Toll Remains In Effect Despite Trump Admin Deadline For Removal&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Trump administration deadline to remove a toll charged to drivers in Manhattan, New York City, by April 20 has not been met by local authorities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 5, the city implemented a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/new-york-citys-congestion-pricing-plan-starts-on-jan-5-everything-you-need-to-know-5783922&quot;&gt;congestion&lt;/a&gt; pricing policy under which drivers of cars, small vans, pickup trucks, and SUVs are charged a $9 toll for entering Manhattan below 60th Street between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. on weekdays and between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rates change during other times based on peak traffic. Trucks, taxis, buses, motorcycles, and Uber services are also subject to the toll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In February, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/department-of-transportation-axes-nyc-congestion-pricing-5812819&quot;&gt;terminated&lt;/a&gt; approval for the congestion pricing policy. &lt;/strong&gt;New York state’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the state agency overseeing the tolls, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/transit-agency-sues-federal-government-for-canceling-manhattan-toll-program-5813194&quot;&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; the federal government for canceling the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOT had initially given the MTA until March 31 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-admin-grants-30-day-extension-for-nyc-to-end-congestion-toll-for-manhattan-drivers-5829116&quot;&gt;stop&lt;/a&gt; the collection of tolls under congestion pricing.&lt;strong&gt; This deadline was later extended by a period of 30 days, until April 20. &lt;/strong&gt;By Sunday’s deadline, congestion pricing was still in effect in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202025-04-21T113209.740.jpg?itok=-Nbu0GQr&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202025-04-21T113209.740.jpg?itok=-Nbu0GQr&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;b4a3b471-aed2-4ccf-a63f-e564397d76aa&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20-%202025-04-21T113209.740.jpg?itok=-Nbu0GQr&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/manhattan-toll-remains-in-effect-despite-trump-admin-deadline-for-removal-5845084?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;But, as Naveen Athrappully reports below for The Epoch Times, &lt;/a&gt;both New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office and the MTA confirmed on Sunday that its system of traffic cameras continues to collect the fee assessed on most cars entering the borough below Central Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The cameras are staying on,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Hochul’s spokesperson Avi Small said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John J. McCarthy, the MTA’s chief of policy and external relations, said, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“In case there were any doubts, MTA, State and City reaffirmed in a court filing that congestion pricing is here to stay and that the arguments Secretary Duffy made trying to stop it have zero merit.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOT said it would not remove the deadline even as the court case plays out, saying it would “not hesitate to use every tool” at its disposal if the state failed to stop the toll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MTA argues that toll fees help raise money to upgrade the city’s aging transit systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hochul previously said the money would underpin $15 billion in debt financing for mass transit capital improvements, with 80 percent of the money to be spent on the subway and bus system and 20 percent on two commuter rail systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trump administration opposed the toll over concerns it negatively affects small businesses and average American citizens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a March 20 statement on social media platform X, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/SecDuffy/status/1902783361900331100&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the “unlawful pricing scheme charges working-class citizens to use roads their federal tax dollars already paid to build.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duffy said Hochul’s “refusal to end cordon pricing“ and her ”open disrespect towards the federal government is unacceptable.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Duffy sent a letter to Hochul regarding the state’s “illegal toll,” according to an April 21 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-gov-hochul-heres-what-continuing-your&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the DOT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has been given 30 days to describe how its noncompliance is not illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the tolls are not stopped by then, or if the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), after evaluating NYSDOT’s response, determines that New York is out of compliance, the agency will take multiple actions, it said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes ceasing further “advance construction” projects within Manhattan and no more National Environmental Policy Act approvals for projects in the borough. The only exception would be if the projects are deemed to be essential for safety, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the noncompliance continues, more restrictive actions will be taken, including ceasing approvals for certain projects within New York City, it said&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corrective measures “may be expanded to other geographic areas within the State of New York if noncompliance continues,” DOT said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;MTA Versus DOT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its &lt;a href=&quot;https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.637159/gov.uscourts.nysd.637159.1.0_1.pdf&quot;&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; against the federal government, MTA said that the FHWA, a division of the DOT, had executed the Value Pricing Pilot Program (VPPP) allowing the congestion toll collection in November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It criticized the Trump administration’s efforts to terminate the congestion pricing, calling them “unlawful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The defendants have provided “no basis” for reversing their position on the program despite having approved it only a few months back, the MTA argued. Defendants in the case include the DOT, FHWA, and Duffy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Neither the VPPP Agreement nor applicable law or regulations permit FHWA to unilaterally terminate the VPPP Agreement,” the lawsuit said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This makes good sense. If FHWA had the right to unilaterally terminate a VPPP program that had already been approved and implemented, it would create uncertainty around the future of such programs any time leadership at FHWA, USDOT, or the White House changed—uncertainty that may make it difficult to issue bonds for other projects and would clearly undermine the purposes of the VPPP.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terminating the VPPP agreement is an “open disregard of a host of federal statutes and regulations” while also violating MTA’s rights under the U.S. Constitution, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Feb. 19 &lt;a href=&quot;https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/memorandum/VPPPletter_termination_021925.pdf&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Hochul, Duffy said New York City’s need for congestion pricing “appears to be driven primarily by the need to raise revenue for the Metropolitan Transit Authority system as opposed to the need to reduce congestion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toll rates set under VPPP “should not be driven primarily by revenue targets,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signs advising drivers of congestion pricing tolls are displayed near the exit of the Lincoln Tunnel in New York City on Feb. 19, 2025. Seth Wenig/AP Photo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duffy said he recognized that the Federal Highway Administration under the Biden administration had deemed the congestion pricing policy eligible for approval under the VPPP initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Federal Highway Administration “did not explain the basis for its conclusion,” he wrote.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the NYSDOT and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) have relied on the VPPP agreement to collect tolls, Duffy said such reliance “should not prevent the termination” of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While NYSDOT and TBTA “have incurred costs related to the program, many of these costs were incurred” before the agreement was signed. The Federal Highway Administration “is not aware of any substantial costs associated with the physical stopping of the program,” the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Manhattan Congestion Toll Remains In Effect Despite Trump Admin Deadline For Removal

            
A Trump administration deadline to remove a toll charged to drivers in Manhattan, New York City, by April 20 has not been met by local authorities.
On Jan. 5, the city implemented a congestion pricing policy under which drivers of cars, small vans, pickup trucks, and SUVs are charged a $9 toll for entering Manhattan below 60th Street between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. on weekdays and between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. on weekends.
The rates change during other times based on peak traffic. Trucks, taxis, buses, motorcycles, and Uber services are also subject to the toll.
In February, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) terminated approval for the congestion pricing policy. New York state’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the state agency overseeing the tolls, then sued the federal government for canceling the program.
The DOT had initially given the MTA until March 31 to stop the collection of tolls under congestion pricing. This deadline was later extended by a period of 30 days, until April 20. By Sunday’s deadline, congestion pricing was still in effect in New York City.



But, as Naveen Athrappully reports below for The Epoch Times, both New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office and the MTA confirmed on Sunday that its system of traffic cameras continues to collect the fee assessed on most cars entering the borough below Central Park.
“The cameras are staying on,” Hochul’s spokesperson Avi Small said.
John J. McCarthy, the MTA’s chief of policy and external relations, said, “In case there were any doubts, MTA, State and City reaffirmed in a court filing that congestion pricing is here to stay and that the arguments Secretary Duffy made trying to stop it have zero merit.”
The DOT said it would not remove the deadline even as the court case plays out, saying it would “not hesitate to use every tool” at its disposal if the state failed to stop the toll.
The MTA argues that toll fees help raise money to upgrade the city’s aging transit systems.
Hochul previously said the money would underpin $15 billion in debt financing for mass transit capital improvements, with 80 percent of the money to be spent on the subway and bus system and 20 percent on two commuter rail systems.
The Trump administration opposed the toll over concerns it negatively affects small businesses and average American citizens.
In a March 20 statement on social media platform X, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the “unlawful pricing scheme charges working-class citizens to use roads their federal tax dollars already paid to build.”
Duffy said Hochul’s “refusal to end cordon pricing“ and her ”open disrespect towards the federal government is unacceptable.”
On Monday, Duffy sent a letter to Hochul regarding the state’s “illegal toll,” according to an April 21 statement from the DOT.
The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has been given 30 days to describe how its noncompliance is not illegal.
If the tolls are not stopped by then, or if the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), after evaluating NYSDOT’s response, determines that New York is out of compliance, the agency will take multiple actions, it said
This includes ceasing further “advance construction” projects within Manhattan and no more National Environmental Policy Act approvals for projects in the borough. The only exception would be if the projects are deemed to be essential for safety, the agency said.
If the noncompliance continues, more restrictive actions will be taken, including ceasing approvals for certain projects within New York City, it said
The corrective measures “may be expanded to other geographic areas within the State of New York if noncompliance continues,” DOT said.

MTA Versus DOT
In its complaint against the federal government, MTA said that the FHWA, a division of the DOT, had executed the Value Pricing Pilot Program (VPPP) allowing the congestion toll collection in November 2024.
It criticized the Trump administration’s efforts to terminate the congestion pricing, calling them “unlawful.”
The defendants have provided “no basis” for reversing their position on the program despite having approved it only a few months back, the MTA argued. Defendants in the case include the DOT, FHWA, and Duffy.
“Neither the VPPP Agreement nor applicable law or regulations permit FHWA to unilaterally terminate the VPPP Agreement,” the lawsuit said.
“This makes good sense. If FHWA had the right to unilaterally terminate a VPPP program that had already been approved and implemented, it would create uncertainty around the future of such programs any time leadership at FHWA, USDOT, or the White House changed—uncertainty that may make it difficult to issue bonds for other projects and would clearly undermine the purposes of the VPPP.”
Terminating the VPPP agreement is an “open disregard of a host of federal statutes and regulations” while also violating MTA’s rights under the U.S. Constitution, the complaint said.
In a Feb. 19 letter to Hochul, Duffy said New York City’s need for congestion pricing “appears to be driven primarily by the need to raise revenue for the Metropolitan Transit Authority system as opposed to the need to reduce congestion.”
Toll rates set under VPPP “should not be driven primarily by revenue targets,” he said.

Duffy said he recognized that the Federal Highway Administration under the Biden administration had deemed the congestion pricing policy eligible for approval under the VPPP initiative.
The Federal Highway Administration “did not explain the basis for its conclusion,” he wrote.
Even though the NYSDOT and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) have relied on the VPPP agreement to collect tolls, Duffy said such reliance “should not prevent the termination” of the agreement.
While NYSDOT and TBTA “have incurred costs related to the program, many of these costs were incurred” before the agreement was signed. The Federal Highway Administration “is not aware of any substantial costs associated with the physical stopping of the program,” the letter said.
The Epoch Times reached out to Hochul and the MTA for comment but did not receive a response by publication time.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortly after taking office, the Trump administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-admin-offers-buyouts-to-nearly-all-federal-employees-5800390&quot;&gt;offered&lt;/a&gt; federal employees a deal many couldn’t refuse: resign voluntarily and receive full benefits and paid leave lasting until September.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%281511%29_0.jpg?itok=6zZHrPgI&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%281511%29_0.jpg?itok=6zZHrPgI&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;2aace347-59db-43bb-9305-2ee41726aa59&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%281511%29_0.jpg?itok=6zZHrPgI&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demonstrators rally outside the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in Washington on Feb. 5, 2025. Nathan Howard/Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than 75,000 workers eventually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/75000-federal-workers-accept-buyout-offer-after-deadline-closes-5809228&quot;&gt;accepted&lt;/a&gt; the Deferred Resignation Program&lt;/strong&gt;, or buyout, which came as part of the administration’s broader efforts to shrink the size of the federal bureaucracy. Since the beginning of President Donald Trump’s second term, the government has already laid off hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the federal government concludes a second round of buyout offers to nudge still more government workers out of the bureaucracy, The Epoch Times spoke with several employees who took the first buyout—and one who was not allowed to take it—about how the decision has affected their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t just Democrats who took the buyout, either: &lt;strong&gt;All who spoke to The Epoch Times about their decision were Trump supporters, and their accepting the offer was based on personal, rather than political, reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; Most asked to remain anonymous over privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former meteorologist told The Epoch Times that the buyout was too good to pass up. He was already eyeing retirement, and the government’s offer simply allowed him to jump-start those plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the most common reason for several others who took the deal as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Page, a former curriculum manager for Army University, said &lt;strong&gt;he and most of his colleagues were in the same situation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Almost everybody in my section also took it. We were all older, or most of us were older, and were thinking about retiring anyway. And this opportunity came up.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page said his department was somewhat superfluous anyway. The employees who were too young to retire—or simply wanted to keep working—were allowed to move to other departments. Those who were already eligible for retirement had their buyout compensation extended to December, making the transition into retirement easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Epoch Times asked Page about his next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;I’m 71, my next chapter is probably dying or something&lt;/strong&gt;,” he joked. “But one of the reasons I didn’t retire until now was because I didn’t know what I would do with myself. I thought I wouldn’t have anything to do, and I was wrong. &lt;strong&gt;I’ve done all kinds of things ... and I’m enjoying myself.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former cybersecurity agent told the Epoch Times that the buyout was “a blessing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 20, eight days before the buyout offer was announced, Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/return-to-in-person-work/&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; federal agency heads to bring employees back into the office “as soon as practicable.” For years, and especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, many federal employees have been permitted work remotely, rarely or never coming into the office physically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this time, the cybersecurity agent said, he and his wife had moved to the midwest and had little desire to return to the east coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, he was eligible to retire in September after a decade of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;So it worked out for me. Like I said, I don’t know if everybody has that experience, but for me, it worked out real well.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone was as enthusiastic about their decision to take the offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One man, a 58-year-old in asset management, told The Epoch Times that he was essentially forced to accept the buyout due to the prohibition on remote work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said he had worked remotely for years when the call to return to the office came in. His agency had a building that was only about a 20 minute drive that he hoped would suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, he later learned that, due to his particular set of duties, he might be required to work out of the Washington office, on the opposite side of the country. He said he didn’t find such a move desirable or financially feasible. Thus, he felt forced to take the buyout and retire two years early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;I wouldn’t get a reduced retirement once I turned 60&lt;/strong&gt;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he said available information at the time “wasn’t full and complete.” His department pushed off any final decision on remote workers beyond the window to take the buyout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertain about whether he&apos;d have to move, he took the offer just to be safe, he said. But he expressed concern that the reduced retirement benefit may cause a bit of financial strain in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone was allowed to take the buyout, which was only available to those not considered “essential.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One young woman, an acquisitions specialist, jumped at the chance to live her dream of being a full-time homemaker when she learned about the offer. She said the lagging economy had forced her to work for over a decade, since she and her husband needed the extra income to support their two small children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her husband expects to receive enough military disability benefits to support the family, but not until later this year. In the interim, she suggested the family is struggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;It’s just kind of hard right now, with just things being so expensive and just not having enough resources.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had hoped to use the buyout to allow her to leave work early and begin homeschooling her 5-year old. But the government rejected her request, labeling her an “essential” worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was kind of frustrating. They promised you, you know, you’re gonna get paid out till September, and then they made it seem like everybody would get approved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had been told beforehand that rejections would be rare, but in her department the opposite turned out to be true. Less than 20 employees were approved, perhaps because the department’s work was deemed to be especially crucial. But she insisted there was still plenty of fat to trim there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;I do see a lot of positions in our agency that they could do away with to save the government money. I feel like they have a lot of employees that do similar jobs that they could kind of cut, especially in our headquarters&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although everyone who spoke to The Epoch Times was in favor of the program—and the reduction in the size of government that prompted it—they also generally felt the Trump administration’s plans had all been conducted a bit hastily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some, like the meteorologist, noted that while there was substantial federal bloat to remove in some agencies, their own departments were already “woefully understaffed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One former employee said that his younger colleague was set to be promoted, but had to wait until workforce reductions were comp.leted. If he had taken the promotion when it was scheduled, it would have put him in “probationary status,” and there was a chance he might have been targeted for firing.&lt;/p&gt;

More than 75,000 workers eventually accepted the Deferred Resignation Program, or buyout, which came as part of the administration’s broader efforts to shrink the size of the federal bureaucracy.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Air Cargo Faces $22BN Revenue Hit When China Tariff Exemption Ends&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Eric Kulisch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freightwaves.com/news/air-cargo-faces-22b-revenue-hit-when-china-tariff-exemption-ends?oly_enc_id=4913D6598389I7Y&quot;&gt;FreightWaves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. plans next month to cancel tariff-free access for low-value parcel shipments from China and Hong Kong, coupled with a new 145% tariff rate on Chinese imports, could bleed more than $22 billion in revenue from the air cargo sector over three years and put thousands of online sellers with direct-to-consumer fulfillment models out of business, according to an e-commerce and logistics consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/buybacks%20restart%20friday_0.jpg?itok=q_MN0Kh8&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/buybacks%20restart%20friday_0.jpg?itok=q_MN0Kh8&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;6771c328-b577-4b58-9001-25c241014d30&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/buybacks%20restart%20friday_0.jpg?itok=q_MN0Kh8&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freightwaves.com/news/new-trump-tariffs-could-decimate-china-e-commerce-airfreight-demand&quot;&gt;Derek Lossing, the founder of Cirrus Global Advisors, has previously said&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration’s recent trade actions against China would “decimate” air cargo out of China because demand for products on the Temu and Shein platforms would plummet. His Seattle-based consultancy has now quantified the downstream effects of the changes on the air cargo sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cirrus Global Advisors model shows the airfreight industry revenue could contract $22 billion if the White House maintains tariffs at 125% for a substantial period of time, based on assumptions about lower consumer demand, excess airline capacity and downward pressure on yields. Large cargo airlines and freighter forwarders, like Atlas Air and Kuehne+Nagel subsidiary Apex Logistics, with heavy exposure to large Chinese marketplaces, as well as Amazon and smaller online brands, are expected to experience downward pressure on revenues, Losing said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The estimate was made before the U.S. clarified that China tariff rate was actually 145%, to include a previous tariff, but it’s unclear if the higher rate would further drag down industry revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-commerce shipments account for an estimated 50% to 60% of China-U.S. air volumes and an estimated 20% of global air cargo volumes, according to logistics providers and the International Air Transport Association. Experts agree that dozens of widebody freighters are dedicated to hauling e-commerce shipments across the Pacific each day from China, but Lossing said he believes an estimate of 100 such aircraft by Netherlands-based consultant Rotate is high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total air cargo revenue on the China-U.S. trade lane will decrease more than 30% because of the lower volumes caused by the new U.S. trade policies and the lower yields that will follow, Lossing, a former Amazon logistics executive, predicted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Biden administration last fall proposed tighter rules for a subset of Chinese goods to qualify for de minimis, a program that allows the duty and tax-free entry of shipments with an aggregate value of $800 or less per person, per day, Cirrus Global Advisors estimated the impact to global air cargo revenue at $3 billion over three years. The estimate for revenue loss has steadily increased with Trump’s aggressive posturing against China before and after his inauguration, culminating with a complete ban of all Chinese goods from duty-free treatment, effective May 2. Starting next Friday, retailers will need to file formal customs entries, which require much more information and time than the fast-track de minimis process, to clear individual shipments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Customs and Border Protection says lax data requirements for de minimis shipments makes it difficult to screen for entry of illicit and unsafe goods. Trump canceled de minimis on the grounds that it enables smuggling of the opioid fentanyl and cheap imports that undercut U.S. retailers and manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limiting de minimis when tariffs were relatively low was mostly considered an inconvenience for large Chinese marketplaces like Temu, Shein and Alibaba because their prices are so low consumers likely wouldn’t change their shopping habits if a piece of clothing increased in price by $2 or $3. But the imposition of 145% tariffs has blown up the model of fulfilling orders in China and shipping them by air directly to the customer’s residence, which was cheaper and faster than shipping in bulk by ocean to a U.S. warehouse for pick, pack and delivery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temu, a hugely popular market for cheap goods, and fast-fashion brand Shein last week notified customers on their websites that they will raise prices starting April 25 in response to new trade rules and rising tariffs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3307050/shein-temu-increase-us-prices-next-week-after-trumps-tariffs-de-minimis-shift&quot;&gt;The South China Morning Post reported&lt;/a&gt; that Temu has already sharply reduced online advertising in the U.S. Despite this, both sites have seen a spike in orders recently as shoppers try to get goods before the tariffs kick in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to higher prices from tariffs, digital markets could lose sales as new customs clearance requirements create friction for customers during checkout, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dereklossing_crossborder-ecommerce-deminimis-activity-7319082283246710784-WA_9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAAANmB2sBMeQdMsVJNvpAPtVoMV__N613n-c&quot;&gt;Lossing predicted Friday on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How comfortable will U.S. online consumers be to provide more, personal sensitive information to shop on a Chinese website, to facilitate a customs declaration for a B2C shipment,” he wrote. If e-commerce hassles and privacy concerns deter consumers from completing purchases the decline in cross-border parcel volumes and air cargo revenues could be even greater than currently forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cirrus model, like others, assumes that the steep drop in China e-commerce shipments to the U.S. will significantly reduce demand for freighter aircraft. Airlines will respond by accelerating the retirement of older aircraft and relocating assets to other markets, resulting in excess capacity there and lower average freight rates. The degree to which express carriers and freighter operators reduce flight schedules or remove aircraft from China service will depend on how much consumers pullback from shopping. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And If the European Commission follows through on intentions to remove the de minimis exemption for goods valued below $170 and impose a customs handling fee on individual B2C packages the harm to cross-border e-commerce players, including all-cargo airlines, could be severe, Losing told FreightWaves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s kind of the one-two punch that actually would potentially push the revenue loss for air cargo over our current estimate,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the potential damage to the industry could spread if the Trump administration, as threatened, eliminates de minimis benefits across all nations once systems are in place to collect tariffs from millions of extra shipments per day. But the harm could also be less severe if the President follows a pattern of quickly undoing policy pronouncements and relaxes the tariffs or de minimis rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Small online sellers at high risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crackdown on Chinese e-commerce shipments poses an existential threat for many small-and-medium e-tailers with storefronts selling goods directly from China, as well as logistics providers that handle customs clearance and last-mile delivery for B2C shippers, said Lossing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large Chinese marketplaces were already preparing for more restrictive de minimis rules by building millions of square feet of U.S. warehouses the past couple of years to support a more traditional B2B2C fulfillment model, logistics executives said. Temu, for example, will consign goods to its U.S. entity, clear them via a formal customs entry, pay duty and truck them to a fulfillment center, where they will be stored, picked, packed and delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason for consolidating air or ocean shipments on one customs entry is to reduce the cost for customs brokerage and merchandise processing fees paid to the government per shipment. The cost for customs brokers to file entries will shoot up from 10 cents to $3 per package once the special de minimis pathway is eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Foreign Trade Council calculates that without de minimis the average $50 package would require about $31 in paperwork, a brokerage fee of $20, plus tariffs and taxes, which would more than double the delivery cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to significantly higher import costs, air shipments are expected to take longer for CBP to process under the standard entry process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lossing said there are tens of thousands of small companies in China that sell on Amazon and other platforms that won’t be able to pay the 145% tariff and don’t have the resources to use a traditional containerized export model. And many customers will switch to countries like Vietnam, where tariffs are lower, for their online orders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shot down arguments that the direct-to-consumer model for e-commerce from China is still viable because it allows merchants to defer tariffs until the actual time of sale versus paying them at a U.S. port of entry and it avoids the risk of having cash tied up in unsold inventory while paying for warehousing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On LinkedIn he challenged the assertion on Bloomberg Television by Izzy Rosenzweig, CEO of e-commerce logistics provider Portless, that the benefits of fulfilling individual orders from China to U.S. residents still made economic sense. Rosenzweig said Shein has plenty of margin to absorb higher import costs, while Temu’s goal is to fulfill 80% of its orders in the domestic U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are some pretty significant data points that show that the China D2C model will not survive at these tariff rates and de minimis closure. I guess only time will tell what happens….The only upside we see for the China-US e-commerce model is air freight rates are set to drop 30%-40% on the trade lane, bringing the cost per parcel down over $1 per unit,” Lossing posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaron Rubin, founder and CEO of ShipHero, a warehouse management software provider for e-commerce brands, said on LinkedIn that FedEx is charging an additional 45 cents per pound on airfreight from China because so many companies are running sales to liquidate their Chinese products for de minimis expires on May 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New tariffs, higher shipping rates and customer friction together “will force all companies to create and implement B2B2C clearance models because asking for sensitive customer information at checkout is a nail in the coffin” for direct-to-consumer fulfillment, Lossing said on LinkedIn. &lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Air Cargo Faces $22BN Revenue Hit When China Tariff Exemption Ends

            
By Eric Kulisch of FreightWaves
U.S. plans next month to cancel tariff-free access for low-value parcel shipments from China and Hong Kong, coupled with a new 145% tariff rate on Chinese imports, could bleed more than $22 billion in revenue from the air cargo sector over three years and put thousands of online sellers with direct-to-consumer fulfillment models out of business, according to an e-commerce and logistics consulting firm. 



Derek Lossing, the founder of Cirrus Global Advisors, has previously said the Trump administration’s recent trade actions against China would “decimate” air cargo out of China because demand for products on the Temu and Shein platforms would plummet. His Seattle-based consultancy has now quantified the downstream effects of the changes on the air cargo sector. 
The Cirrus Global Advisors model shows the airfreight industry revenue could contract $22 billion if the White House maintains tariffs at 125% for a substantial period of time, based on assumptions about lower consumer demand, excess airline capacity and downward pressure on yields. Large cargo airlines and freighter forwarders, like Atlas Air and Kuehne+Nagel subsidiary Apex Logistics, with heavy exposure to large Chinese marketplaces, as well as Amazon and smaller online brands, are expected to experience downward pressure on revenues, Losing said in a phone interview.
The estimate was made before the U.S. clarified that China tariff rate was actually 145%, to include a previous tariff, but it’s unclear if the higher rate would further drag down industry revenue.
E-commerce shipments account for an estimated 50% to 60% of China-U.S. air volumes and an estimated 20% of global air cargo volumes, according to logistics providers and the International Air Transport Association. Experts agree that dozens of widebody freighters are dedicated to hauling e-commerce shipments across the Pacific each day from China, but Lossing said he believes an estimate of 100 such aircraft by Netherlands-based consultant Rotate is high.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Mississippi Supreme Court Shuts Down Teen&apos;s Bid For Masculine Name Amid Gender Transition&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an 8–1 decision issued April 17,&lt;strong&gt; the state’s highest court sided with a lower court judge who previously denied the teen&apos;s request&lt;/strong&gt;, concluding that Mississippi law gives judges discretion over name changes for minors and that such changes must clearly serve the best interests of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%281505%29_0.jpg?itok=6daH7_Qv&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%281505%29_0.jpg?itok=6daH7_Qv&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;c77f3a84-d84d-4f0c-9ee5-765e33eadc3f&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%281505%29_0.jpg?itok=6daH7_Qv&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mississippi Supreme Court in Jackson on Oct. 13, 2022. Kenneth C. Zirkel, Wikimedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The minor, identified in court documents as S.M.-B., first petitioned for a name change through her mother in July 2023&lt;/strong&gt;. The request, which was uncontested and had the support of the teen’s father as well, was part of her gender transition, her attorney told the Hinds County Chancery Court during a Nov. 6 hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She identified as a male, and would like to be known as a male … through school, through college, preparing for college and so forth,” the attorney stated during the hearing, according to the Supreme Court’s opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Judge Tametrice Hodges denied the request later that month, ruling&lt;strong&gt; the teen should “mature” further before the court considers such a change.&lt;/strong&gt; She dismissed the petition without prejudice, meaning it could be refiled later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On appeal, attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union, representing the teen, argued that the lower court lacked discretion to deny the petition because it was uncontested. “&lt;strong&gt;Most [chancery court judges] grant uncontested minor name changes as a matter of course,&lt;/strong&gt;” the ACLU said in a brief urging the state high court to take up the case. “The Mississippi Supreme Court must make clear the legal standard for this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Justice James Maxwell, writing for the majority, rejected the ACLU’s argument.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The petitioner’s primary appellate argument is that the [judge] had no discretion to deny the name-change petition because it was uncontested and both parents agreed,” Maxwell wrote. “But Mississippi law says otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He cited existing precedent, noting tha&lt;strong&gt;t the right to change one’s name typically applies to “any person of mature years” - not minors.&lt;/strong&gt; Under Mississippi law, minors are defined as individuals under the age of 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court also emphasized that &lt;strong&gt;a name change for a minor may only be granted when it is “clearly in the best interest of the child” &lt;/strong&gt;- and that trial judges have the discretion to make that determination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only one justice, Leslie King, dissented&lt;/strong&gt;. He slammed the lower court for what he called a “deficient” record, writing that the trial court apparently conducted a bench conference off the record, took no evidence, and ended the hearing without allowing testimony from the minor or her parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;It is clear that further development of the facts in this case are necessary,&lt;/strong&gt;” King wrote. “I find that the record is deficient and that the deficiency renders this Court unable to properly determine whether the chancery court dismissed the petition for correct or incorrect reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother had told the court that her daughter’s given name made her transition “more difficult.” &lt;strong&gt;Both parents supported the petition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case adds to the growing legal battles in the U.S. over how states handle gender identity issues involving minors. Mississippi’s ruling underscores that, in the Magnolia State, youth undergoing transition face strict judicial scrutiny — even when their families are on board.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Mississippi Supreme Court Shuts Down Teen&apos;s Bid For Masculine Name Amid Gender Transition

            
The Mississippi Supreme Court ruled this week that a 16-year-old biological female undergoing gender transition procedures cannot legally change her name to a more masculine one.
In an 8–1 decision issued April 17, the state’s highest court sided with a lower court judge who previously denied the teen&apos;s request, concluding that Mississippi law gives judges discretion over name changes for minors and that such changes must clearly serve the best interests of the child.

On appeal, attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union, representing the teen, argued that the lower court lacked discretion to deny the petition because it was uncontested. “Most [chancery court judges] grant uncontested minor name changes as a matter of course,” the ACLU said in a brief urging the state high court to take up the case. “The Mississippi Supreme Court must make clear the legal standard for this issue.”
But Justice James Maxwell, writing for the majority, rejected the ACLU’s argument.
“The petitioner’s primary appellate argument is that the [judge] had no discretion to deny the name-change petition because it was uncontested and both parents agreed,” Maxwell wrote. “But Mississippi law says otherwise.”
He cited existing precedent, noting that the right to change one’s name typically applies to “any person of mature years” - not minors. Under Mississippi law, minors are defined as individuals under the age of 21.
The court also emphasized that a name change for a minor may only be granted when it is “clearly in the best interest of the child” - and that trial judges have the discretion to make that determination.
Only one justice, Leslie King, dissented. He slammed the lower court for what he called a “deficient” record, writing that the trial court apparently conducted a bench conference off the record, took no evidence, and ended the hearing without allowing testimony from the minor or her parents.
“It is clear that further development of the facts in this case are necessary,” King wrote. “I find that the record is deficient and that the deficiency renders this Court unable to properly determine whether the chancery court dismissed the petition for correct or incorrect reasons.”
The mother had told the court that her daughter’s given name made her transition “more difficult.” Both parents supported the petition.
The case adds to the growing legal battles in the U.S. over how states handle gender identity issues involving minors. Mississippi’s ruling underscores that, in the Magnolia State, youth undergoing transition face strict judicial scrutiny — even when their families are on board.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;They said communism was a threat to democracy because it usurps the will of the people, it imposes government controls over everything from the media to the means of production, to wealth and economic redistribution,” Benz recently told podcast host Benny Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benz is calling for the wholesale declassification of the intelligence communities efforts to suppress populism, along with congressional investigations and hearings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The point is, is any act of the people that undermines elements of their control is categorized as a threat to democracy and subjected to the same apparatus that we constructed during the war on communism. &lt;strong&gt;And I believe this story can really only be fully told through declassifications and hearings that are similar to the church committee hearing,&lt;/strong&gt;” Benz said. “And that framework for understanding nationalism and populism, as opposed to socialism and communism in the 1960s and 70s, has to run through every element of control by the IC that was weaponized at home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since departing the State Department, Benz has led efforts to expose government, especially intelligence community, involvement in censoring free speech on social media. A key focus was the Global Engagement Center (GEC), originally established in 2007 as the Counterterrorism Communication Center to combat propaganda from groups like Al-Qaeda. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/political/rubio-chops-offshoot-tentacle-global-engagement-center-same-roster-employees&quot;&gt;Rebranded&lt;/a&gt; as the GEC in 2016 under President Obama, it shifted to countering foreign disinformation. Despite its foreign focus, the GEC faced accusations in legal cases for participating in the Election Integrity Partnership (EIP), which flagged election-related disinformation on social media, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/rubio-announces-closure-of-office-tracking-foreign-disinformation-over-censorship-concerns-5842927?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&amp;src_src=partner&amp;src_cmp=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;Epoch Times&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the closure of the Global Engagement Center (GEC), criticizing its role in suppressing Americans’ free speech.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Over the past half-decade, bodies like GEC, crafted by our own governing ruling class, nearly destroyed America’s long free speech history,” Rubio wrote in an op-ed for &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefederalist.com/2025/04/16/rubio-to-protect-free-speech-the-censorship-industrial-complex-must-be-dismantled/&quot;&gt;The Federalist&lt;/a&gt;. “The enemies of speech had new lingo to justify their authoritarian impulse. It was ‘disinformation,’ allegedly pushed by nefarious foreign governments, that was the No. 1 threat to ‘our democracy.’ To protect ‘our democracy,’ this ‘disinformation’ had to be identified and stamped out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rubio highlighted a 2020 GEC report that labeled public speculation about the origins of the COVID-19 virus&lt;/strong&gt;—such as claims it was an “engineered bioweapon” or linked to “research conducted at the Wuhan institute”—as part of a “Russian disinformation apparatus.” He noted that the GEC not only flagged specific claims as foreign propaganda but also targeted individual users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2025/01/24/nx-s1-5270071/eo-weaponization&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; an executive order banning government censorship to safeguard free speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No longer will our government label the speech of our own citizens as misinformation or disinformation, which are the favorite words of censors and those who wish to stop the free exchange of ideas and, frankly, progress,” Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2025/01/24/nx-s1-5270071/eo-weaponization&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;the World Economic Forum. “&lt;strong&gt;We have saved free speech in America, and we’ve saved it strongly with another historic executive order.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chinese Plastics Factories Face Mass Closure As US Ethane Disappears</title>
      <link>https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/chinese-plastics-factories-face-mass-closure-us-ethane-disappears</link>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Chinese Plastics Factories Face Mass Closure As US Ethane Disappears&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously we explained that the US-China trade war has been unique in that the US was hit fast and hard, mostly through capital markets and financial linkages, which travel instantaneously with acute consequences (the recent dump of US treasuries by China and subsequent purchases of the yuan and perhaps gold took effect in milliseconds, and prompted a cottage industry of narratives how the US dollar is losing its reserve currency status). At the same time, the impact to the Chinese economy takes a while to propagate, as supply chains take weeks if not months to normalize to a new status quo; the period is even longer when the frontrunning of tariffs meant China would overproduce in the days leading up to the outbreak of the trade war, and keep economic output artificially inflated, as demonstrated by the paradoxically strong Q1 GDP numbers out of Beijing. Yet once the slowdown hits, as it inevitably will, the consequences for China - which unlike the US has no social safety net - will be far more dire. It also means that the trade war with China will apex only once Beijing suffers max pain, at which point Xi will be far more amenable to talks with Trump. The only question is when will said max pain moment hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&apos;t know yet, although we are keeping a close eye on alternative Chinese economic indicators (one can&apos;t trust official Chinese data in normal times, and one certainly can&apos;t trust any local &quot;data&quot; at a time when gepolitical leverage is measured in growth basis points, even if they are completely fabricated) for the tipping point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, however, there are growing signs that the first wave of pain has already landed, and as Bloomberg reports, &lt;strong&gt;Chinese plastics factories that depend on a gas they mainly import from the US are contending with the prospect of widespread shutdowns &lt;/strong&gt;as the world’s two largest economies bunker down for a prolonged trade war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world’s dominant plastics manufacturer gets almost all its ethane, a petrochemical feedstock that is also a component of natural gas, from the US. But eye-watering tariffs on American goods mean plants that cannot process substitute raw materials will bleed money; their only alternative is to mothball production for the near (or not so near) future.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;The situation is dire for China’s ethane crackers as they have no alternative to US supply,” &lt;/strong&gt;said Manish Sejwal, an analyst at Rystad Energy AS, using an industry term for such facilities. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Unless they are granted tariff exemptions, they may have to stop production or close shop.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, that would be catastrophic for China&apos;s plastics industy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most so-called crackers in China use naphtha as a feedstock, &lt;strong&gt;with processors that solely use ethane as raw material for petrochemicals making up is less than 10% of the total at about 4 million tons&lt;/strong&gt;, according to Rystad. China is by far the biggest buyer of American supply, according to the US Energy Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/china%20ethane%20purchase.jpg?itok=ZS6mqY0S&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/china%20ethane%20purchase.jpg?itok=ZS6mqY0S&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;bfe733c5-c279-4b0f-8511-40ef38c98b67&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;278&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/china%20ethane%20purchase.jpg?itok=ZS6mqY0S&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with 125% tariffs in place, &lt;strong&gt;factories would have lost $184 for every ton of US ethane they processed in the week ending April 11, &lt;/strong&gt;according to Rystad data. That compares with more than $100 they would have made in profits if there were no tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Bloomberg, the extra costs are another blow for China’s plastics sector, &lt;strong&gt;which is already dealing with a glut as the growth in production capacity exceeds demand&lt;/strong&gt;. The tussle is also threatening other feedstocks, including natural gas liquids and propane, &lt;strong&gt;and has led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/china-s-us-decoupling-collapses-trade-in-key-petroleum-product&quot;&gt;sharp drops in US prices&lt;/a&gt;, hardly the inflationary shock so many have predicted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/oil%20to%20ethane.png?itok=E3ueFh6M&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/oil%20to%20ethane.png?itok=E3ueFh6M&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;baf98d88-0a62-4eab-8942-8ceeec41abf0&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;459&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/oil%20to%20ethane.png?itok=E3ueFh6M&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across China, domestic ethane production won’t be able to plug the gap, with the nation producing around 120,000 tons in 2024, according to industry consultancy JLC International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the ethane market “is marked by long-term contracts, with little to no opportunity to resell cargoes on the spot market,” Rystad said April 10, making it tough for the Chinese to obtain alternative supplies from non-US sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China has so far avoid widespread closures of production across sectors, it appears likely that the plastics industry in general, and the ethane and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/china-s-us-decoupling-collapses-trade-in-key-petroleum-product&quot;&gt;propane supply chains &lt;/a&gt;in particular, will be among those hit first and hardest. So for those seeking to time the moment of max pain, and greatest malleability of Beijing, keep an eye on Chinese plastic prices and/or labor strikes in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lower the former goes, the higher the latter will move, and the faster the trade war will come to an end. And come to an end it will, because as even Goldman forecast in its latest China forecast (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/51nsnatljv8bhjdorblxe/China_-Q1-GDP-and-March-activity-data-broadly-beat-expectations-1.pdf?rlkey=rfqagq4l1c3ik8x5d7xnc7tqa&amp;dl=0&quot;&gt;available to pro subs here&lt;/a&gt;), the country&apos;s GDP is about to fall off a cliff: &lt;strong&gt;the bank now expects China&apos;s Q2 GDP growth to crater to just 0.8% QoQ from 4.9% in Q1. &lt;/strong&gt;And that&apos;s just the start, if China is unable to unleash a stimulus similar in size to what it did during covid.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Chinese Plastics Factories Face Mass Closure As US Ethane Disappears

            
Previously we explained that the US-China trade war has been unique in that the US was hit fast and hard, mostly through capital markets and financial linkages, which travel instantaneously with acute consequences (the recent dump of US treasuries by China and subsequent purchases of the yuan and perhaps gold took effect in milliseconds, and prompted a cottage industry of narratives how the US dollar is losing its reserve currency status). At the same time, the impact to the Chinese economy takes a while to propagate, as supply chains take weeks if not months to normalize to a new status quo; the period is even longer when the frontrunning of tariffs meant China would overproduce in the days leading up to the outbreak of the trade war, and keep economic output artificially inflated, as demonstrated by the paradoxically strong Q1 GDP numbers out of Beijing. Yet once the slowdown hits, as it inevitably will, the consequences for China - which unlike the US has no social safety net - will be far more dire. It also means that the trade war with China will apex only once Beijing suffers max pain, at which point Xi will be far more amenable to talks with Trump. The only question is when will said max pain moment hit.
We don&apos;t know yet, although we are keeping a close eye on alternative Chinese economic indicators (one can&apos;t trust official Chinese data in normal times, and one certainly can&apos;t trust any local &quot;data&quot; at a time when gepolitical leverage is measured in growth basis points, even if they are completely fabricated) for the tipping point. 
Until then, however, there are growing signs that the first wave of pain has already landed, and as Bloomberg reports, Chinese plastics factories that depend on a gas they mainly import from the US are contending with the prospect of widespread shutdowns as the world’s two largest economies bunker down for a prolonged trade war.
The world’s dominant plastics manufacturer gets almost all its ethane, a petrochemical feedstock that is also a component of natural gas, from the US. But eye-watering tariffs on American goods mean plants that cannot process substitute raw materials will bleed money; their only alternative is to mothball production for the near (or not so near) future.  
&quot;The situation is dire for China’s ethane crackers as they have no alternative to US supply,” said Manish Sejwal, an analyst at Rystad Energy AS, using an industry term for such facilities. &quot;Unless they are granted tariff exemptions, they may have to stop production or close shop.&quot;
Needless to say, that would be catastrophic for China&apos;s plastics industy.
Most so-called crackers in China use naphtha as a feedstock, with processors that solely use ethane as raw material for petrochemicals making up is less than 10% of the total at about 4 million tons, according to Rystad. China is by far the biggest buyer of American supply, according to the US Energy Department.



But with 125% tariffs in place, factories would have lost $184 for every ton of US ethane they processed in the week ending April 11, according to Rystad data. That compares with more than $100 they would have made in profits if there were no tariffs. 
According to Bloomberg, the extra costs are another blow for China’s plastics sector, which is already dealing with a glut as the growth in production capacity exceeds demand. The tussle is also threatening other feedstocks, including natural gas liquids and propane, and has led to sharp drops in US prices, hardly the inflationary shock so many have predicted.



Across China, domestic ethane production won’t be able to plug the gap, with the nation producing around 120,000 tons in 2024, according to industry consultancy JLC International.
Furthermore, the ethane market “is marked by long-term contracts, with little to no opportunity to resell cargoes on the spot market,” Rystad said April 10, making it tough for the Chinese to obtain alternative supplies from non-US sources.
While China has so far avoid widespread closures of production across sectors, it appears likely that the plastics industry in general, and the ethane and propane supply chains in particular, will be among those hit first and hardest. So for those seeking to time the moment of max pain, and greatest malleability of Beijing, keep an eye on Chinese plastic prices and/or labor strikes in the region.
The lower the former goes, the higher the latter will move, and the faster the trade war will come to an end. And come to an end it will, because as even Goldman forecast in its latest China forecast (available to pro subs here), the country&apos;s GDP is about to fall off a cliff: the bank now expects China&apos;s Q2 GDP growth to crater to just 0.8% QoQ from 4.9% in Q1. And that&apos;s just the start, if China is unable to unleash a stimulus similar in size to what it did during covid.

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently trying to out-hawk the late John McCain, Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick has &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RepBrianFitz/status/1913299824494944423&quot;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; that he recently traveled to Ukraine and spent several days at the front lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 51-year old Republican rep from Pennsylvania spent a total of a week inside the war-ravaged country, visiting soldiers while making declarations that Ukraine and the US will defeat the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitzpatrick even did a provocative photo op wherein he &lt;strong&gt;signed an artillery shell &quot;to Putin&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. And even more alarming is that he &lt;strong&gt;filmed himself firing a large gun&lt;/strong&gt;, which may have been an anti-aircraft weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/fitz.jpg?itok=oChiZIGD&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/fitz.jpg?itok=oChiZIGD&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;4338cda2-912f-43a0-a690-c63e47bd14b2&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/fitz.jpg?itok=oChiZIGD&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s unclear whether he was manning the gun near an actual combat zone, or if he was really engaging a target. Likely it was at some kind of training or firing range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it&apos;s clear the Congressman was trying to be as provocative against the Russians as possible, at a moment a Republican president is trying to forge peace between Moscow and Kiev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, Fitzpatrick traveled around with Ukraine’s National Guard Artillery and Third Assault Brigade - the latter which is made up of &lt;strong&gt;Azov&lt;/strong&gt; Special Operations soldiers and is commanded by Andriy Biletsky, who has long been accused of having neo-Nazi links and ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wrote on X after the trip, &quot;It was my &lt;strong&gt;profound honor to deliver a very ‘personal’ message to Vladimir Putin today, from the front lines of the war near the Russian border&lt;/strong&gt;, on behalf of our PA-1 community.  The only permissible details to share are that &lt;strong&gt;‘the message was delivered on target.’&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does suggest he may have been firing on or near an actual war zone - though the security risks would be enough to probably prevent him from getting very close to any real fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitzpatrick has been receiving significant backlash over the stunt, especially as it could harm the cause of Trump&apos;s efforts to negotiate peace settlement. In addressing &apos;messages&apos; directly to Putin, it seems a deliberate effort at sabotaging peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gen. Mike Flynn (ret.) ripped the Congressman, &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/GenFlynn/status/1913651220847223035&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; on X: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;How stupid can you be?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Congressman Visits Ukraine Frontlines, Filmed Firing Heavy Weapon

            
Apparently trying to out-hawk the late John McCain, Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick has described that he recently traveled to Ukraine and spent several days at the front lines.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Protectionism Is Good&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amgreatness.com/2025/04/11/protectionism-is-good/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Josiah Lippincott via American Greatness,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independence is freedom. Dependence is slavery. &lt;/strong&gt;The more independence you have, the more choices you can make and the freer you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_10-53-50.jpg?itok=lrb2V7nD&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_10-53-50.jpg?itok=lrb2V7nD&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;5e0d558b-a45a-49f7-a32d-2ce21b4f3366&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-20_10-53-50.jpg?itok=lrb2V7nD&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more you need things from other people, the fewer choices you have, and the more you must obey the whims of others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are poor, then you must work in order to live. You must trade your time and energy for sustenance, or you will die. Therefore, you must give up your freedom of choice to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Necessity constrains you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wealth, by contrast, gives you choices.&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t have to take the first menial job you see just to put food on the table. Your money gives you power and flexibility. You can be your own boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-sufficiency—being independent—is critical to freedom and happiness. Relationships of desire replace those of necessity and convenience; friendship replaces subordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this life, we can never wholly be free of necessity, but it is best to minimize our needs as much as possible. The frugal and prudent man sets up hedges around his wealth. He takes out “insurance” against the possibility of trouble and saves for a rainy day. He is moderate in his spending, avoids debt, and pays off his creditors quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This common-sense wisdom is just as applicable at the national as at the individual level. A prudent nation does not sell off its future for cheap pleasures in the present; it works to liberate itself from dependence on foreigners and enemies; it prepares for hard times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A prudent nation is, to the maximum extent possible, self-reliant and frugal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The globalist liberal economic regime is none of these things. Indeed, the free traders insist that the wisdom of prudence and frugality is &lt;em&gt;folly &lt;/em&gt;and even tyrannical, that autarky, or self-sufficiency, is ruin, and that dependence on foreigners is prosperity and power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade, of course, is a source of wealth. Specialization creates efficiency, and efficiency creates wealth. Instead of doing many things poorly, a worker can focus on doing one thing extremely well. He then trades the excess of his labor with others for what he needs and wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a large enough scale, this trade between different specialists or workers creates far greater prosperity than if every man had to care for himself. In the state of nature, self-sufficiency is painful and hard to acquire. The individual by himself is vulnerable to injury, death, robbery, and famine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thousand dangers threaten him on every side. But when he allies with others, he is less weak. The more cords you wrap together, the stronger the rope becomes. Strength compounds strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But this strengthening has an upper limit.&lt;/strong&gt; An alliance between men must be a true alliance. The members must care for one another and share their mutual commitment to the same high degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot ally with people who hate you or who seek to defraud you. An alliance is a two-way street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Globalists don’t understand this principle, however.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of WWII, the Allied nations, giddy with victory and smug in their liberal values, believed that the whole world could live as one, that the population of the earth could enter into one giant alliance. It is from this idea that we get the “United Nations,” quite literally the nations of the earth were to be united into one global community rooted in shared democratic values. After the fall of the Soviet Union, it appeared that this liberal project had been realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every nation on earth had entered into a new era free from tyranny and the petty jealousies of the old geopolitical order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liberals used this rationale to justify massive outsourcing in the American economy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipping jobs abroad lowered labor costs, brought cheaper prices, and raised the value of American companies. With fewer liabilities on their balance books, stocks rose to soaring heights. Returns blossomed. Investments boomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True enough, the United States had outsourced innumerable key industries abroad.&lt;/strong&gt; Today, 99 percent of our medications, shoes, and fish are acquired from abroad, primarily from China. But for liberals, this was a small price to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free trade makes a nation wealthy. Global free trade should make it even wealthier. And where wealth goes, democracy is sure to follow. Democracy means peace. Peace means happiness. All would be well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This promise was a lie. The nations of the earth do not share a fundamental interest. Democracy does not guarantee peace. Free trade does not make for endless prosperity. The delusions of a global order of freedom are hollow to the core. Indeed, they are evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID lockdowns made this clear. If liberalism and free trade lead to ever more freedom, how does one explain the global panic over a respiratory virus, a panic so intense it led to the American government unilaterally suspending the rights of free association, worship, and speech for years at a time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It wasn’t just America, either. Western nations transformed themselves into open-air prison camps. After the initial wave of hysteria passed, relentless vaccine mandates came. The freedom of bodily autonomy was suspended on an almost global scale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID threw back the curtain on the liberal world order and revealed its rotten, tyrannical, and insane heart, but it was not the only warning sign. Far from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nations of the earth do not share a common interest. The explosion in BLM violence, anti-White DEI policies, and the relentless condemnations of American history for its bigotry and White supremacy make clear that no such reconciliation has yet occurred or is even possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more migrants pour into America, the more our social cohesion frays, and the more our once-shared history is condemned and destroyed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and America, for instance, obviously pursue different interests. If they were the same, then we should simply unite and form one nation with a common citizenship. This would not work, of course. No one today would even dream of proposing such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of uniting with Russia is even more absurd. Liberals foam at the mouth over Putin’s actions in Ukraine, viciously condemning the foreign policy of our one-time ally in WWII. The Russians, moreover, have no interest in being adversaries or even junior partners in the neoliberal world order. They want respect and a seat at the table, and they are willing to fight for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At home, America’s rural communities are in shambles. &lt;/strong&gt;Once high-paying middle-class factory jobs have been wiped out. Empty factories dot the plain. Large swaths of America look like they lost a war: the buildings are falling apart, and the population is filled with foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “interdependent” global economy has made Americans worse off in virtually every possible way.&lt;/strong&gt; The only pathway to success today is through the “new economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every single one of my non-STEM college-educated millennial peers is working in law, finance, real estate, marketing, the non-profit sector, or for the government. They do not own businesses making real goods or employing real people. They are in industries that depend on government largesse, donations from the wealthy (derived primarily from equities), or working for the same stock-rich individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wealth increasingly concentrates in fewer and fewer hands. A few major cities—San Francisco, New York City, and Washington, DC—wield immense political and economic power. The scramble to get access to this wealth has given enormous influence to those in power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is much easier to cancel someone who works in a coveted laptop class job than it is to cancel a small-business owner who makes key components for a critical national industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralization makes censorship and gatekeeping much easier.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is obvious to those with eyes to see and ears to hear that our contemporary economic situation is not sustainable. We cannot keep going on like this. COVID was a blaring warning of the grave dangers of globalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America must choose a new path. We must choose the path of self-reliance, frugality, moderation, and prudence. We must choose to embrace national sovereignty and rejuvenation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 80 years, the American ruling class has been selling America off for parts. Our privileged geopolitical situation, isolated from Asia and Europe by vast oceans, our intelligent and industrious population, our ethnic homogeneity, our vast natural resources, and our open space are an immense source of wealth. For decades, the grifters and parasites were able to sell and sell and sell. They defrauded their countrymen of jobs, opportunities, and possibilities. We have indebted our children and sold off their inheritance to enjoy pleasures in the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of this is disgusting and contemptible. We need a reckoning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tariffs and borders will deliver the national economy we deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the short run, asset valuations and wages are inversely correlated. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more a company must pay its workers, the less profit it can offer investors. For a corporation, high wages are a &lt;em&gt;liability&lt;/em&gt;. Yet, this logic is stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the long run, the greatest asset a company has is the workers who make it up. &lt;/strong&gt;Without their labor and insight, the company would not exist. High wages make our civil society stronger. Workers who feel like they have skin in the game are more patriotic, more motivated, and more eager to sacrifice for the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If forced to choose between corporate profits or higher wages, we should choose higher wages. Exporting jobs abroad to cheap Chinese laborers is a form of fraud. It is a betrayal. Good jobs should exist right here in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High wages mean better working conditions and better worker safety. America wouldn’t need minimum wage laws if the labor market were tight enough. True, corporations sacrifice profits in this arrangement, but those profits weren’t ever theirs to sacrifice. Workers and owners need each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot sell out either one (through outsourcing or socialist revolution, respectively) without incurring deep economic and political wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capitalism and private property work best when capital and property are distributed broadly and freely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, CEO compensation to average worker salary was about 20:1. This is a fair deal. It is right for those in charge, who ensure the business exists at all, to be better compensated than those who merely clock in and out. But today, this ratio has grown out of all proportion: it is now 400:1. The average CEO makes 400 times what his worker makes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American workers deserve more respect.&lt;/strong&gt; Without them, none of our national wealth would be possible! Competition with cheap foreign labor is a race to the bottom. It is suicide. We need the American worker to have purchasing power and excess capital. We need him to be confident and strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means protecting him from foreign competition that sacrifices living standards for money. Americans deserve their dignity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need strong borders, too. There is no point in re-shoring factories only to fill them with immigrants. &lt;/strong&gt;Third-world immigrants, especially, are a blight. They are often clannish, resentful, and grasping. They do not care about the nation or its history. They want money. They think the older White majority is racist and bad. They vote overwhelmingly Democrat. They need to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immigration drives up housing prices, too.&lt;strong&gt; God isn’t making any more land. Artificially inflating the price of homes and space by an endless flow of migrants is a government subsidy towards those who already own homes at the expense of those who wish to acquire them. This is not fair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to America’s vast resources and our (still) high-quality native population, we should have become less dependent on foreign trade as we became wealthier, not more. Trade is a product of excess wealth beyond the needs of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the life of the American republic, our native industries were small and inefficient compared to those of Europe. American farmers, therefore, would trade commodities for relatively cheap manufactured goods abroad. But this dynamic created dependency. Americans became wealthier due to trade, but they also became needy. They had to have these manufactured goods to keep growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tariffs incentivized Americans to pour their excess labor into making manufactured goods instead of more commodities made abroad. That policy made America into an industrial powerhouse in its own right instead of a satellite of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need a similar policy now in order to recover high middle-class wages and a stable internal economy that isn’t dependent on foreign trade to maintain prosperity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an individual or global perspective, foreign trade creates prosperity. From the standpoint of the nation-state, it is a sign of misallocated capital. If America can only eat 50 million bushels of wheat, but we grow 100 million bushels, then this is a sign we have too many people making wheat. In the short run, it is better to ship that excess abroad in order to trade for luxuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long run, it is better to turn the excess labor of making wheat for export into making the foreign luxuries right here at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nation with as many resources and as much space as the United States, autarky is much more feasible than for nations like Japan or North Korea. While true autarky is not achievable or desirable—foreign trade and travel are part of individual freedom—it is good to encourage internal manufacturing as much as is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariffs strike the right balance:&lt;/strong&gt; they impose costs on foreign goods while channeling revenue back into the nation. The individual maintains access to foreign goods, even though this can harm domestic manufacturers, while paying into the commonwealth of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariffs are good. They protect the high American standard of living, make us more independent of foreign countries, and encourage innovation right here at home. Tariffs benefit us all. They are a necessary hedge to protecting American wealth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Protectionism Is Good

            
Authored by Josiah Lippincott via American Greatness,
Independence is freedom. Dependence is slavery. The more independence you have, the more choices you can make and the freer you are.



The more you need things from other people, the fewer choices you have, and the more you must obey the whims of others.
If you are poor, then you must work in order to live. You must trade your time and energy for sustenance, or you will die. Therefore, you must give up your freedom of choice to live.
Necessity constrains you.
Wealth, by contrast, gives you choices. You don’t have to take the first menial job you see just to put food on the table. Your money gives you power and flexibility. You can be your own boss.
Self-sufficiency—being independent—is critical to freedom and happiness. Relationships of desire replace those of necessity and convenience; friendship replaces subordination.
In this life, we can never wholly be free of necessity, but it is best to minimize our needs as much as possible. The frugal and prudent man sets up hedges around his wealth. He takes out “insurance” against the possibility of trouble and saves for a rainy day. He is moderate in his spending, avoids debt, and pays off his creditors quickly.
This common-sense wisdom is just as applicable at the national as at the individual level. A prudent nation does not sell off its future for cheap pleasures in the present; it works to liberate itself from dependence on foreigners and enemies; it prepares for hard times.
A prudent nation is, to the maximum extent possible, self-reliant and frugal.
The globalist liberal economic regime is none of these things. Indeed, the free traders insist that the wisdom of prudence and frugality is folly and even tyrannical, that autarky, or self-sufficiency, is ruin, and that dependence on foreigners is prosperity and power.
They are wrong.
Trade, of course, is a source of wealth. Specialization creates efficiency, and efficiency creates wealth. Instead of doing many things poorly, a worker can focus on doing one thing extremely well. He then trades the excess of his labor with others for what he needs and wants.
On a large enough scale, this trade between different specialists or workers creates far greater prosperity than if every man had to care for himself. In the state of nature, self-sufficiency is painful and hard to acquire. The individual by himself is vulnerable to injury, death, robbery, and famine.
A thousand dangers threaten him on every side. But when he allies with others, he is less weak. The more cords you wrap together, the stronger the rope becomes. Strength compounds strength.
But this strengthening has an upper limit. An alliance between men must be a true alliance. The members must care for one another and share their mutual commitment to the same high degree.
You cannot ally with people who hate you or who seek to defraud you. An alliance is a two-way street.
Globalists don’t understand this principle, however. 
In the aftermath of WWII, the Allied nations, giddy with victory and smug in their liberal values, believed that the whole world could live as one, that the population of the earth could enter into one giant alliance. It is from this idea that we get the “United Nations,” quite literally the nations of the earth were to be united into one global community rooted in shared democratic values. After the fall of the Soviet Union, it appeared that this liberal project had been realized.
Every nation on earth had entered into a new era free from tyranny and the petty jealousies of the old geopolitical order.
Liberals used this rationale to justify massive outsourcing in the American economy. 
Shipping jobs abroad lowered labor costs, brought cheaper prices, and raised the value of American companies. With fewer liabilities on their balance books, stocks rose to soaring heights. Returns blossomed. Investments boomed.
True enough, the United States had outsourced innumerable key industries abroad. Today, 99 percent of our medications, shoes, and fish are acquired from abroad, primarily from China. But for liberals, this was a small price to pay.
Free trade makes a nation wealthy. Global free trade should make it even wealthier. And where wealth goes, democracy is sure to follow. Democracy means peace. Peace means happiness. All would be well.
This promise was a lie. The nations of the earth do not share a fundamental interest. Democracy does not guarantee peace. Free trade does not make for endless prosperity. The delusions of a global order of freedom are hollow to the core. Indeed, they are evil.
COVID lockdowns made this clear. If liberalism and free trade lead to ever more freedom, how does one explain the global panic over a respiratory virus, a panic so intense it led to the American government unilaterally suspending the rights of free association, worship, and speech for years at a time?
It wasn’t just America, either. Western nations transformed themselves into open-air prison camps. After the initial wave of hysteria passed, relentless vaccine mandates came. The freedom of bodily autonomy was suspended on an almost global scale.
COVID threw back the curtain on the liberal world order and revealed its rotten, tyrannical, and insane heart, but it was not the only warning sign. Far from it.
The nations of the earth do not share a common interest. The explosion in BLM violence, anti-White DEI policies, and the relentless condemnations of American history for its bigotry and White supremacy make clear that no such reconciliation has yet occurred or is even possible.
The more migrants pour into America, the more our social cohesion frays, and the more our once-shared history is condemned and destroyed.
China and America, for instance, obviously pursue different interests. If they were the same, then we should simply unite and form one nation with a common citizenship. This would not work, of course. No one today would even dream of proposing such a thing.
The idea of uniting with Russia is even more absurd. Liberals foam at the mouth over Putin’s actions in Ukraine, viciously condemning the foreign policy of our one-time ally in WWII. The Russians, moreover, have no interest in being adversaries or even junior partners in the neoliberal world order. They want respect and a seat at the table, and they are willing to fight for them.
At home, America’s rural communities are in shambles. Once high-paying middle-class factory jobs have been wiped out. Empty factories dot the plain. Large swaths of America look like they lost a war: the buildings are falling apart, and the population is filled with foreigners.
The “interdependent” global economy has made Americans worse off in virtually every possible way. The only pathway to success today is through the “new economy.”
Every single one of my non-STEM college-educated millennial peers is working in law, finance, real estate, marketing, the non-profit sector, or for the government.

It is much easier to cancel someone who works in a coveted laptop class job than it is to cancel a small-business owner who makes key components for a critical national industry.
Centralization makes censorship and gatekeeping much easier.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have heard from Washington at various levels that Ukraine’s membership in NATO is out of the question,&quot; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a Monday press briefing. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;This is something that satisfies us and coincides with our position.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ukraine should not be a member of NATO and should not have prospects for integration with it,&quot; Peskov said. &quot;This would be a threat to the national interests of the Russian Federation. And &lt;strong&gt;this is one of the root causes of the conflict&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/peskzel.jpg?itok=Yq0GAE-d&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/peskzel.jpg?itok=Yq0GAE-d&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;65ab3251-fbbf-4706-98b3-47359fd7a68e&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/peskzel.jpg?itok=Yq0GAE-d&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is reportedly waiting on the Zelensky government to respond to the package of proposals which Washington wants Kiev and Europe to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peskov signaled in his remarks that &lt;strong&gt;questions &quot;especially about a time frame&quot; are not the big priority right now&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;which contradicts President Trump&apos;s insistence&lt;/strong&gt; that the two warring sides quickly get to the negotiating table with days or weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared Monday that Moscow has a &lt;strong&gt;&quot;positive attitude&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; toward genuine efforts to create peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky is expected to convey a decision at a meeting in London later this week. He stipulated on X, &quot;An unconditional cease-fire must be the first step toward peace, and this &lt;strong&gt;Easter made it clear that it is Russia’s actions that are prolonging the war&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went to say the weekend Easter truce was but a PR smokescreen meant to fool Europe and the US on Putin&apos;s truce intentions. He accused Russia of having repeatedly violated it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for what&apos;s said to be another key aspect to the US plan for peace - Crimea&apos;s status - the Kremlin was more guarded on this, given final word on this from Washington apparently hasn&apos;t been conveyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Anonymously sourced media reports regarding efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict should be &lt;strong&gt;taken with a grain of salt&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; Peskov &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rt.com/russia/616053-kremlin-crimea-us-recognition/&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; in response to a question about potential American recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are numerous reports circulating,&quot; Peskov stated. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;The search for a peaceful resolution must not be conducted publicly... For this reason, anonymous claims should be evaluated with utmost caution.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crimea was taken by the Kremlin in 2014 following the CIA/western-orchestrated overthrow of then president Yanukovich in the Maidan coup, and Russia subsequently held a referendum to validate its control but the international community has resisted recognizing the peninsula as Russian to avoid legitimizing the annexation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky has lately and repeatedly stressed he will not cede territory to Moscow, and so have European leaders. He and Ukraine and some European officials argue that doing so risks undermining international laws and treaties prohibiting the taking of land through use of force.&lt;/p&gt;

The Kremlin has belatedly reacted to Washington proposals toward ending the war in Ukraine, by praising and welcoming the Trump administration&apos;s ruling out Ukraine joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); however, as The Wall Street Journal reports in the wake of high-level meetings in Europe last week, Moscow &quot;showed no urgency in reaching a deal.&quot;

&quot;Anonymously sourced media reports regarding efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict should be taken with a grain of salt,&quot; Peskov warned in response to a question about potential American recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea.
&quot;There are numerous reports circulating,&quot; Peskov stated. &quot;The search for a peaceful resolution must not be conducted publicly... For this reason, anonymous claims should be evaluated with utmost caution.&quot;
Crimea was taken by the Kremlin in 2014 following the CIA/western-orchestrated overthrow of then president Yanukovich in the Maidan coup, and Russia subsequently held a referendum to validate its control but the international community has resisted recognizing the peninsula as Russian to avoid legitimizing the annexation.
Zelensky has lately and repeatedly stressed he will not cede territory to Moscow, and so have European leaders. He and Ukraine and some European officials argue that doing so risks undermining international laws and treaties prohibiting the taking of land through use of force.

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/drugged-into-oblivion-more-than-60-percent-of-u-s-adults-admit-that-they-are-taking-pharmaceutical-drugs/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans watch more television than anyone else in the world, and as we watch television we are constantly being bombarded by commercials from pharmaceutical companies.  As I discussed &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaeltsnyder.substack.com/p/33-shocking-facts-that-prove-that?utm_source=publication-search&quot;&gt;in a previous article&lt;/a&gt;, pharmaceutical companies spend more than 15 billion dollars on television advertising each year.  The reason they do this is because it works.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are the most drugged nation in the history of the world, and the pharmaceutical companies are absolutely swimming in cash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Snip20250417_4.jpg?itok=JU50k6I8&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Snip20250417_4.jpg?itok=JU50k6I8&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;3639137c-8ec0-46fb-b026-04f02e3c53d1&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Snip20250417_4.jpg?itok=JU50k6I8&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to polling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/public-opinion-on-prescription-drugs-and-their-prices/#:~:text=Prescription%20drugs%20touch%20the%20lives,topline%20for%20full%20question%20wording.&quot;&gt;that was conducted by KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a whopping 61 percent of all U.S. adults admit that they are currently taking at least one pharmaceutical drug.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a solid majority of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once they have you on one drug, they are much more likely to be able to get you on another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KFF survey found that 13 percent of U.S. adults are taking one pharmaceutical drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KFF survey found that 11 percent of U.S. adults are taking two pharmaceutical drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The KFF survey found that 10 percent of U.S. adults are taking three pharmaceutical drugs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And most shocking of all, the KFF survey found that 27 percent of U.S. adults are taking at least four pharmaceutical drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means that more than a quarter of the adult population is currently on at least four &lt;a href=&quot;https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/drugged-into-oblivion-more-than-60-percent-of-u-s-adults-admit-that-they-are-taking-pharmaceutical-drugs/#&quot;&gt; prescription medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is insane!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is where we are at as a society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elderly Americans are the biggest victims.  One study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/more-older-adults-need-prescriptions/&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; “that an estimated 89 percent of older adults” took at least one &lt;a href=&quot;https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/drugged-into-oblivion-more-than-60-percent-of-u-s-adults-admit-that-they-are-taking-pharmaceutical-drugs/#&quot;&gt; prescription medication&lt;/a&gt; within the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you aren’t sick, the system is designed to find a reason why you should become a customer of the big pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example, the percentage of Americans that have been diagnosed with depression &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14618323/tom-cruises-2005-warning-big-pharma-data-americans-antidepressants.html&quot;&gt;has more than tripled&lt;/a&gt; since 2005…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, new CDC data showed that nearly 18 percent of Americans had depression in 2023, an all-time high. In 2005, when Cruise’s controversial interview aired, that figure was about 5.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, it is so easy to be diagnosed with depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just act a little bit sad, and they will gladly start giving you pills.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is particularly true for women.  According to Google AI, women in the United States are using antidepressants at a rate that is more than twice as high as men…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted in 2015-2018, approximately 17.7% of women aged 18 and older reported using antidepressants in the past 30 days. This is significantly higher than the rate for men, which was 8.4%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been on antidepressants, you already know how they can mess with your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen it happen to people that I know personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what is going to happen to the millions of Americans that are highly dependent on these drugs if they suddenly can’t get them anymore?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we import approximately 75 percent of our essential medicines, and most of those essential medicines come &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/supply-chain-ai-company-sounds-alarm-over-americas-reliance-chinese-made-pharmaceuticals&quot;&gt;from either China or India&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Exiger, the U.S. currently imports 75% of its essential medicines, with most of them coming from China and India. While India produces about half of the generic drugs the U.S. imports, it relies heavily on China for 80% of its active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). More than 500 generic drugs rely on one country’s APIs, including treatments for diabetes and heart conditions as well as antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor putting Americans at risk is the use of forced labor in the production of pharmaceuticals. Exiger found that multiple suppliers, including Sinopharm, Zhejiang Shindai Chemical Group and Zhejiang Chemicals Export Corp., relied on Uyghur forced labor in Xinjiang. Customs and Border Patrol is supposed to block goods made with forced labor; however, some still get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have got a real mess on our hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many pharmaceutical drugs will soon become much more expensive, and in other cases we could witness extreme shortages.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions of U.S. adults are about to experience a very rude awakening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it isn’t just adults that are being drugged into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, millions of American boys are being given drugs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailywire.com/news/the-experts-are-finally-admitting-that-adhd-is-a-scam&quot;&gt;for ADHD&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 21% of 14-year-old boys in this country now supposedly suffer from this condition. The number goes up to 23% for 17-year-old boys. As a result, prescriptions for drugs like Ritalin and Adderall have skyrocketed. From 2012 to 2022, the total number of prescriptions for stimulants to treat ADHD increased dramatically by nearly 60%. Boys between the ages of 10 to 14 were the demographic that saw the highest increase in these prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we are witnessing is a national tragedy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the boys that are taking these drugs simply do not need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Glenn Back has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theblaze.com/shows/the-glenn-beck-program/drugged-for-being-boys-the-truth-behind-the-adhd-scam&quot;&gt;accurately pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;our “feminized education system” tends to punish normal male behavior…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The truth is we’ve been told not that a feminized education system has increasingly punished normal male behavior it doesn’t understand; it’s not that schools have lost their capacity to educate male students; it’s not that smartphone use and electronics in general have become distractions teachers have been unable to control. Instead, we’re led to believe that boys have suddenly become afflicted with a severe psychological disorder,” Glenn reads from the Daily Wire piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He agrees that what’s being done to boys in education is a travesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everything is just push the girls, push the girls, push the girls — ‘you can be anything.’ ‘Shut up, sit down, have some Ritalin’ to the boys,” he condemns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boys who are being written off as distractible and out of control are really just being typical boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been trained to think that typical male behavior is abnormal when it most certainly is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, an increasing percentage of U.S. adults now believe that children are such a “burden” that they don’t want to be parents &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infowars.com/posts/number-of-us-adults-who-dont-want-children-has-doubled-over-past-20-years-study-finds&quot;&gt;at all&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study shows the number of U.S. adults who do not want to have children has doubled in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found that the percentage of non-parents who don’t want any children rose from 14% in 2002 to 29% in 2023,” Jennifer Watling Neal, co-author of the study and professor of psychology at Michigan State University (MSU), said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“During the same period, the percentage of non-parents who plan to have children in the future fell from 79% to 59%,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The relentless propaganda that they have been feeding us is working.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More U.S. adults than ever before are completely rejecting parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Needless to say, this is a recipe for societal suicide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we do not reproduce ourselves, we can’t expect to have any sort of a positive future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, millions of Americans simply do not care about the future at this point because they have already been drugged into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Drugged Into Oblivion: More Than 60% Of US Adults Admit That They Are Taking Pharmaceutical Drugs

            
Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,
Americans watch more television than anyone else in the world, and as we watch television we are constantly being bombarded by commercials from pharmaceutical companies.  As I discussed in a previous article, pharmaceutical companies spend more than 15 billion dollars on television advertising each year.  The reason they do this is because it works.  We are the most drugged nation in the history of the world, and the pharmaceutical companies are absolutely swimming in cash.



According to polling that was conducted by KFF, a whopping 61 percent of all U.S. adults admit that they are currently taking at least one pharmaceutical drug.
That is a solid majority of the population.
And once they have you on one drug, they are much more likely to be able to get you on another.

And most shocking of all, the KFF survey found that 27 percent of U.S. adults are taking at least four pharmaceutical drugs.
That means that more than a quarter of the adult population is currently on at least four  prescription medications.
That is insane!
But this is where we are at as a society.
Elderly Americans are the biggest victims.  One study found “that an estimated 89 percent of older adults” took at least one  prescription medication within the past 12 months.
Even if you aren’t sick, the system is designed to find a reason why you should become a customer of the big pharmaceutical companies.
For example, the percentage of Americans that have been diagnosed with depression has more than tripled since 2005…

      <title>Why More People Are Testing Their Blood Without A Doctor</title>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Why More People Are Testing Their Blood Without A Doctor&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/why-more-people-are-testing-their-blood-without-a-doctor-5834300?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&amp;src_src=partner&amp;src_cmp=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;Authored by Sheramy Tsai via The Epoch Times&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis ours),&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale doesn’t lie—but it doesn’t tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might be eating better, exercising more, and still seeing the same number each morning. It’s frustrating, discouraging, and, as it turns out, possibly misleading.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, weight has been treated as a primary marker of health. But a number on the scale says little about inflammation, cardiovascular risk, or metabolic dysfunction—factors that often shift before any visible weight loss appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s why more people are turning to at-home biomarker testing&lt;/strong&gt;—health tracking that looks beneath the surface, revealing internal changes long before they’re visible in the mirror or on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/SiPhox_MainImage.png?itok=fSLDty7a&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/SiPhox_MainImage.png?itok=fSLDty7a&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;576f1140-47f8-4972-9840-2ff90ac1e196&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/SiPhox_MainImage.png?itok=fSLDty7a&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colin Godby, an engineer and father of two, tested his blood out of curiosity, not concern. What he found was unexpected—and alarming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The at-home test revealed that Godby had hereditary hemochromatosis, a genetic condition that causes iron to accumulate in the body. Left untreated, it can lead to liver disease, heart problems, and other complications. It was a diagnosis standard labs hadn’t caught—and likely wouldn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’d been chalking up fatigue and joint pain to getting older,” he said. “But this gave me answers. Real ones.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What stood out to Godby wasn’t just the result—it was the realization that he might never have discovered the issue through routine care. He hadn’t planned to see a doctor, and even if he had, a ferritin test likely wouldn’t have been part of a standard workup.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I realized how blind I was to the nuance of my health,” said Godby. “And how likely it would be for many other people to also have potential issues they might not know about.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;From COVID-19 Swabs to Full Panels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, millions swabbed their noses at home and waited for COVID-19 test results—an experience that introduced many to the idea of testing health at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;COVID normalized the idea that you could test yourself and act on the results&lt;/strong&gt;,” said Jordan Moradian, a product and growth manager at SiPhox Health, a direct-to-consumer testing company, in an interview with The Epoch Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the pandemic, health tracking was gaining traction among wellness enthusiasts. COVID-19 accelerated the trend, Moradian said, fueled by renewed interest in immunity, more time at home, and popular science voices like Andrew Huberman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;https://siphox.zhstore.com/&quot; data-image-href=&quot;https://siphox.zhstore.com/&quot; data-link-option=&quot;2&quot; href=&quot;https://siphox.zhstore.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;031ad96b-2717-4ef4-bef2-c0f7b49b563e&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;141&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/SiPhox_0.png?itok=X9iBcJqg&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Order SiPhox blood tests over our secure portal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, companies like SiPhox, Everlywell, LetsGetChecked, and QuestHealth offer clinical-grade diagnostics at home. Tests typically use finger-prick or saliva samples to measure everything from blood sugar and inflammation to hormones and cholesterol—and deliver results in days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The global home testing market, valued at more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/home-care-testing-market-report&quot;&gt;$10.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2024, is projected to nearly double by 2030&lt;/strong&gt;, according to Grand View Research. The growth reflects a shift toward preventive, patient-led care—emphasizing early detection, frequent monitoring, and personal agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the Doctor’s Office&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At-home blood testing gives people more control over their health, often filling gaps left by conventional care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most annual checkups include only basic labs—typically a lipid panel and perhaps a comprehensive metabolic panel. However, these often exclude markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, hormone balance, or cardiovascular risk. As a result, early signs of chronic disease may go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Many people turn to at-home biomarker tracking to test markers their physicians may not typically order,&lt;/strong&gt;” Moradian said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In places where diagnostics are limited, these tools offer a fuller health picture before a clinical visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appeal is not just access, but speed. Instead of waiting months for a follow-up panel, users can adjust their lifestyle and retest within weeks, getting near real-time feedback on what’s working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moradian identified three groups driving demand: people recovering from health scares who want early warnings; younger, data-driven users testing diets or supplements; and those in “medical deserts” with limited access to care.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most revealing data come from what routine checkups miss, he said. Many users discover elevated ApoB—a key heart disease marker—even with normal cholesterol. Others uncover hormonal imbalances, such as low testosterone, rarely screened for in standard exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, this internal data becomes more than diagnostic—it becomes personal. The numbers link daily choices to real biological change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Motivation in the Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bathroom scale is slow to move and quick to frustrate. Blood work, by contrast, offers internal proof that change is happening&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;even before it’s visible. A drop in blood sugar, a dip in inflammation, or a hormone shift can be more motivating than what’s seen in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Improvements in biomarkers almost always come before visible weight changes,” said Dr. Robert Lufkin, a physician and author of “Lies I Taught in Medical School,” in an email interview with The Epoch Times. “Tracking blood sugar or inflammation offers real-time feedback—often before any physical changes show up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moradian sees the same pattern. “Biomarker tracking offers a holistic view of one’s health,” he said. “When someone pursues weight loss, they can also see parallel improvements in blood pressure or kidney function—changes that would otherwise go unnoticed if they focused solely on the scale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;This ‘whole-picture’ perspective is hugely motivating&lt;/strong&gt;,” he added. “&lt;strong&gt;Seeing multiple indicators trend positively reinforces that lifestyle changes are working even before outward, easily visible progress appears&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a culture obsessed with appearance, internal markers offer a deeper kind of progress:&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;one rooted in biology, not vanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How Accurate Are At-Home Tests?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As at-home blood testing grows, many wonder if the results are as reliable as those from a doctor’s office. Companies like SiPhox say yes—if the right standards are met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;A common misconception is that at-home testing isn’t as accurate or reliable as clinical testing,&lt;/strong&gt;” Moradian said. “In reality, &lt;strong&gt;reputable at-home tests employ rigorously validated methodologies and must meet strict regulatory standards.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SiPhox processes tests through Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists-accredited labs, which are federally certified for accuracy and oversight. &lt;/strong&gt;The company reports a 95 percent to 99 percent match with standard venous draws, benchmarked quarterly against labs like LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not all tests meet these standards. Experts urge consumers to look past marketing and ask key questions: Is the lab certified? Are the tests validated? Do clinicians review results?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Association for Diagnostics &amp; Laboratory Medicine (ADLM) &lt;a href=&quot;https://myadlm.org/advocacy-and-outreach/position-statements/2024/direct-to-consumer-laboratory-testing&quot;&gt;supports&lt;/a&gt; at-home testing only through certified labs that provide clear explanations and follow-up options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Consumer-directed laboratory testing can provide valuable information,” said Anthony Killeen, the group’s president, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/adlm-supports-use-of-direct-to-consumer-tests-from-reputable-labs-with-appropriate-guidance-302293185.html&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. However, he emphasized that it must be used appropriately and with support from qualified professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADLM has also warned about quality gaps, calling for tighter regulation of misleading or poorly validated tests. As the industry grows, the group’s message is clear: Convenience must not come at the cost of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Limits of At-Home Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At-home blood testing offers fast, easy access to health data and the promise of early detection. However, experts warn that more data doesn’t always lead to better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One risk is over-testing. Like daily weigh-ins, frequent checks of glucose or inflammation can fuel anxiety over normal fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Frequent testing without proper context can lead to anxiety, overanalysis, and obsession with small, normal fluctuations,&lt;/strong&gt;” said Lufkin. “Not every spike or dip is meaningful—bodies are dynamic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is interpretation. Without a doctor’s guidance, users may make diet or supplement decisions based on a single number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Self-monitoring is intended to complement professional medical advice, not replace it,” said Moradian. “We encourage users to share their biomarker data with their health care providers, fostering collaborative decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://meridian.allenpress.com/aplm/article/144/10/1193/444916/Benefits-and-Risks-of-Direct-to-Consumer-Testing&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine echoed this concern, noting that consumers “may not know the risks or what significance a result has.” In some cases, false positives led to unnecessary procedures, added costs, and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy is another issue. A 2023 &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2809595&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that fewer than half of direct-to-consumer companies followed HIPAA guidelines. Only four allowed users to delete their data, while over half admitted they could share it for research or with third parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost is another barrier. While tests may appear cheaper than lab visits, a full panel can cost $75 to $300, and few are covered by insurance. For frequent users, the price adds up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Your Body, Your Baseline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At-home testing shifts the focus from population averages to personal baselines—moving health tracking from what works for most to what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea underpins “N=1 medicine,” a growing movement in which individuals act as their own experiments. Instead of relying on annual checkups or generic advice, users collect data, track trends, and make changes based on what works for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where to begin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lufkin recommends starting with a foundational lab panel that includes fasting insulin, fasting glucose, HbA1c (a longer-term marker of blood glucose levels), triglycerides and HDL (to calculate the ratio), CRP (a marker of inflammation), LDL-C, and vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These give a snapshot of your metabolic and inflammatory status—far more informative than weight or BMI,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once you have your baseline, Lufkin advises a gradual, focused approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick one change, such as cutting added sugar, walking after meals, or improving sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Track how you feel—energy, mood, cravings, and digestion often shift before lab numbers do.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Retest every three to six months to monitor trends and confirm your direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even small improvements confirm that your efforts are working—long before the mirror shows it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, at-home testing isn’t about micromanaging every fluctuation. “You don’t need to be perfect—just curious,” Lufkin said. “Let data guide your next best step. That’s real empowerment.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Why More People Are Testing Their Blood Without A Doctor

            
Authored by Sheramy Tsai via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
The scale doesn’t lie—but it doesn’t tell the whole story.
You might be eating better, exercising more, and still seeing the same number each morning. It’s frustrating, discouraging, and, as it turns out, possibly misleading.
For decades, weight has been treated as a primary marker of health. But a number on the scale says little about inflammation, cardiovascular risk, or metabolic dysfunction—factors that often shift before any visible weight loss appears.
That’s why more people are turning to at-home biomarker testing—health tracking that looks beneath the surface, revealing internal changes long before they’re visible in the mirror or on the scale.



Colin Godby, an engineer and father of two, tested his blood out of curiosity, not concern. What he found was unexpected—and alarming.
The at-home test revealed that Godby had hereditary hemochromatosis, a genetic condition that causes iron to accumulate in the body. Left untreated, it can lead to liver disease, heart problems, and other complications. It was a diagnosis standard labs hadn’t caught—and likely wouldn’t have.
“I’d been chalking up fatigue and joint pain to getting older,” he said. “But this gave me answers. Real ones.”
What stood out to Godby wasn’t just the result—it was the realization that he might never have discovered the issue through routine care. He hadn’t planned to see a doctor, and even if he had, a ferritin test likely wouldn’t have been part of a standard workup.
“I realized how blind I was to the nuance of my health,” said Godby. “And how likely it would be for many other people to also have potential issues they might not know about.”
From COVID-19 Swabs to Full Panels
During the pandemic, millions swabbed their noses at home and waited for COVID-19 test results—an experience that introduced many to the idea of testing health at home.
“COVID normalized the idea that you could test yourself and act on the results,” said Jordan Moradian, a product and growth manager at SiPhox Health, a direct-to-consumer testing company, in an interview with The Epoch Times.
Even before the pandemic, health tracking was gaining traction among wellness enthusiasts. COVID-19 accelerated the trend, Moradian said, fueled by renewed interest in immunity, more time at home, and popular science voices like Andrew Huberman.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;What American Hardline Retailers Are Saying about Tariff Fallout&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman analysts met with management and investor relations teams from specialty hardline retailers (BBY, BJ, DG, DKS, FL, OLLI, RH, TGT, ULTA, WMT, WOOF) to assess tariff exposure, consumer behavior, and macroeconomic challenges amid 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/us-tariffs-rate-return-fdr-era-levels-goldman-says-economy-far-stronger-1930s&quot;&gt;average US tariff rate at its highest since the 1930s&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-19_10-16-12.png?itok=UuI_vZ1i&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-19_10-16-12.png?itok=UuI_vZ1i&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;68c67f7d-e28c-4def-bd05-718ed2337624&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;323&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-19_10-16-12.png?itok=UuI_vZ1i&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the conversations Kate McShane, Mark Jordan, and other analysts had with IR and management teams from retailers: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Buy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tariff exposure and impacts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Given President Trump&apos;s recent exclusion of electronics from tariffs, management noted that their exposure is likely even lower than the 20% remaining China tariff. BBY is still trying to figure out their tariff situation by talking to vendors, but noted that most of their COGS that originate from Mexico are under exclusion as well (leaving them at low exposure for Mexico). Management also emphasized that the tariff exposure to comp headwind correlation is not linear, as vendors have multiple sites of manufacturing and it is largely dependent on the trade offs vendors make. When comparing tariffs to 2018/2019, they noted that last time, tariffs came through on large appliances, and most of the product categories did not get hit much since they were also exempted. At the moment, management does not believe they have taken prices up (they anticipate tariffs impacting 2Q-4Q), and as of last earnings call, have not brought in any inventory early for tariffs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Navigating consumer elasticity and macroenvironment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Management stated that their guidance takes into account their potential estimate for consumer elasticity, as they accounted for factors such as product levels, vendor price increases, potential declines in purchased units, etc. They are also involved in weekly planning given the macro-environment, and are preparing themselves and their vendors to be ready in case of any quick tariff changes. In the case of a recession, management noted that there are still many levers they could move to preserve profitability, such as changing labor demand and reducing various SG&amp;A expenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BJ&apos;s Wholesale Club&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BJ could benefit as a limited SKU retailer when it comes to tariffs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; General merchandise comprises less than 15% of BJ&apos;s overall business. Management explained that BJ&apos;s limited SKU count and reliance on a treasure hunt experience gives the company more flexibility than some others. For example, BJ could forgo certain SKUs and offset that with other SKUs, making calculated choices depending on the situation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BJ expects to see SG&amp;A deleverage this year but automation helps offset&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. On the 4Q earnings call, BJ guided to SG&amp;A deleverage, driven by an acceleration in new club openings, particularly with continued outsized growth in depreciation as the company owns more of the clubs its opens. BJ plans to be disciplined from an overall cost perspective. Management also noted that the use of automation, such as autonomous robots in inventory, can help minimize footsteps and labor hours, allowing for more labor hours to go towards customer-facing tasks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dollar General&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improved execution leading to trade-in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. In their last earnings call, DG noted that the trade-down between higher income consumers has been accelerating between 4Q and 1Q. Management noted that the reason they didn&apos;t see this trade-down earlier is likely due to some consumers taking a little longer to feel pressure, but also because of improved company execution. DG believes they are in a better spot today to receive trade-down needs than they were 6-9 months ago, which will allow them to create better impacts on their trade-in customers. Specifically, management noted that they are better positioned in their in-stock levels, SKU reduction strategies, and are investing more in their back-to-basics, which is translating to the top line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;No significant changes on SNAP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Management stated that they are watching SNAP carefully and believes that the low income consumer is still under pressure, but has not confirmed any significant changes related to SNAP. They noted that in the past they have seen significant impacts when there are full-scale cuts on SNAP, but it is not as impacted when it is only work requirement changes. They also stated that if there were certain foods removed from SNAP, they would likely see more of a gradual impact than immediate, given that the consumer will not stop buying the foods they regularly eat immediately. Currently, SNAP accounts for ~MSD of DG&apos;s sales.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DICK&apos;S Sporting Goods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;DKS&apos;s position in a difficult macro backdrop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Per management, DKS is uniquely positioned in the marketplace, especially during challenging times, as its offering enables people to go outside and manage stress in an accessible way. Additionally, people are not willing to forgo things they consider essential, such as cleats that fit their kids or running shoes, which they often view as more necessary than discretionary. In terms of Game Changer, management highlighted that it has become an indispensable piece of the youth sports ecosystem and remains confident in the business in a tougher macroeconomic environment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company could benefit from elevated inventory. Exiting 4Q, DKS&apos;s inventory was up 18%, more for other reasons (e.g., its Southern store strategy, strategic investments) versus getting ahead of tariffs. As a result, there could be some unintended benefits from the higher inventory. The inventory consists of some seasonal and some core product, and it was a focused investment into certain brands categories that have been fueling top line growth to keep the momentum going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foot Locker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FL&apos;s tariff exposure&lt;/strong&gt;. FL&apos;s private label is a LSD percent of sales, with about half of that being sourced through China and the balance through other Southeast Asian countries. FL&apos;s partners also have exposure to China, while noting their exposure to that region has come down over the past several years, particularly following 2018/19 tariffs. Per management, the company is working through this with their partners through a lens of mutual profitability. FL noted that their outlook for the year still suggests that they will continue to make progress against their Lace Up plan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FL noted its inventory was in a good place coming out of 4Q. &lt;/strong&gt;FL&apos;s inventory levels were up 1% coming out of 4Q, and the company saw improved inventory turns last year. Per management, FL wants to leave some flexibility to lean into any traffic-driving promotions, rather than needing to clear inventory. In terms of inventory management, FL plans to continue to be agile and respond to the overall macro environment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ollie&apos;s Bargain Outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supply chain opportunity and flexibility in the current environment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Management addressed investor concerns that supply chain opportunities could be limited in the near term if tariffs persist, by noting that OLLI has already factored that into their strategies, and is continuing to aggressively buy product. In the case that supply chain products are limited, management is not worried given that there is still a lot of merchandise from distressed stores and bankruptcies. While they have not currently seen mass cancellations of orders yet, they highlighted that once more imports arrive from China, companies will have to start canceling orders, likely allowing OLLI to benefit from this excess merchandise. Management also noted that they are currently buying more domestic product and are not buying certain product categories from China (the only category at risk is seasonal items); however, they are not worried about their product mix, as their consumers are trained for a treasure hunt environment. Given OLLI does not have a set planogram merchandise model, consumers are not expecting them to have the same products every time, which allows OLLI&apos;s buyers to flexibly chase different products.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoration Hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RH plans to work through its elevated inventory which will help with FCF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; RH has $200-300mn in excess inventory, with the company noting it bought heavily in advance into its new collections which were trending well. RH plans to work through the inventory this year, without providing a timeline on when this will be done. The company is not buying as much unless it is new collections (i.e., new items in its sourcebooks) or for customers&apos; custom orders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;While the macro remains challenging, RH seeks to benefit from newness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; RH sees an impact on its customer base when mortgage rates go above 7%. In terms of correlation with the stock market, wealthy customers might wait and not purchase in a certain month, and in general, the company sees a correlation between mortgage rates and existing home sales. Per management, RH set out to gain market share with newness, noting that from 2019-22, the company did not offer newness. RH noted it is currently benefiting from the transformation through market share gains, given its compelling offering, scale, and pricing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Levers RH could pull in a difficult environment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. RH noted it could potentially monetize assets through sale leasebacks, which it has done in the past. The company added that its marketing spend is over $100mn, which it could cut back on, along with salaries, corporate headcount, or ongoing projects/investments. RH pointed to its 4/6/20 press release (linked here) as an example of what it has done historically.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prices will likely increase, while elasticity is hard to predict.&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of direct exposure to China, private label is 30% of sales, and 30% of their private label comes from China. Direct imports are more in home and apparel, while indirect is more of electronics and toys. TGT noted that unit demand is going to be tough, and elasticity is hard to predict as it changes over time depending on the macro backdrop. Per management, the expectation is that everyone will have to take price. That said, TGT highlighted that it maintains a strong balance sheet and feels good about its ability to manage this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TGT plans to remain agile on its inventory position&lt;/strong&gt;. TGT noted it has not brought in product early to any great degree in the current environment as there is not limitless storage, while adding it has a mindset to remain ready and agile. We would note that TGT ended the year with ~7% y/y inventory growth, which management noted in March was a function of strategic decisions versus sitting on unproductive inventory. Given TGT&apos;s guests over-index to interest in newness and on-trend product, the company was trying to get a jump start on the year and pulled forward some receipts (e.g., spring sets for hardlines and apparel).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ulta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop openings will pause in 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; At a recent conference, ULTA mentioned it would not be opening additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations this year and would instead be focusing on the existing 610 stores. Per ULTA, this decision will allow the company to incorporate learnings and strengthen existing stores before continuing the expansion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ULTA&apos;s tariff exposure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. In FY24, only ~1% of ULTA&apos;s receipts were direct imports, noting this is mostly related to the Ulta Beauty Collection and gifts with purchases. ULTA is talking with its manufacturers and suppliers on how to mitigate tariff impacts. The Ulta Beauty Collection has exposure to China but also Canada and Europe. Prestige brands are more exposed to North America and Europe, while mass has more exposure to China/Asia. On the indirect side, it is more difficult as ULTA works with 600 brands, which includes smaller brands without broad global supply chains.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ulta hires new Chief Merchandise Officer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. On 4/17, Ulta announced they hired Lauren Brindley as their new Chief Merchandising Officer to replace retiring CMO, Monica Arnaudo. When speaking with the company, they highlighted Ms. Brindley&apos;s more than 20 years of experience in beauty, from both the retail and brand perspective and her experience and relationships across the beauty spectrum, from mass to luxury. Ms. Brindley also led the development of the Boots No 7 brand and has strong brand building experience. Additionally, having served as a CEO of Revolution Beauty, she brings an enterprise view to the merchandising and digital role.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walmart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discretionary categories are underperforming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. WMT has not pulled forward inventory in anticipation of tariffs due to the uncertain backdrop. The company plans to lean heavily into value, noting the more discretionary side of general merchandise is underperforming. That said, seasonal events remain productive for WMT, and the company plans to focus on grocery for upcoming events, while for back-to-school, it will lean into consumables.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WMT is benefiting from automation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. 60% of WMT&apos;s fulfillment volume today is moving through automation, and ~55% of stores are receiving automated freight. The automation cycle is scheduled to roll out through 2029, with cost savings already there today but not sizable enough yet to call out. As a result of automation, inventory efficiency has increased over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sam&apos;s Club is well-positioned for omnichannel growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. WMT is positioning Sam&apos;s Club as an omnichannel club, noting that the market still feels underpenetrated. The Sam&apos;s Club and Walmart US e-commerce supply chains are merging, and e-commerce fulfillment will be done through the Walmart system. As a result, per management, the cost is much lower and the network already exists. While clubs are usually for a stock up versus a top up trip, prepared meals is one of the fastest growing areas for Sam&apos;s Club.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Petco&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commentary on tariffs and pricing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Management noted that owned brands represent 5% of COGS with exposure in China, Mexico, and Canada, with China being the largest. The company also noted that price hike and 10+ mitigation strategies have been under consideration with the aim to mitigate potential impacts on national brands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Competition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The company had no specific update on peer activity. Management has been focused on defining Petco&apos;s position in the market and identifying differential points. The company is focused on understanding the core customer with an emphasis on internal brand definition, analyzing broader industry dynamics, and going back to retail basics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key takeaway is clear: investors and consumers should favor retailers with supply chains outside of China, while penalizing those that are heavily reliant on Chinese imports. &lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>What American Hardline Retailers Are Saying about Tariff Fallout

            
Goldman analysts met with management and investor relations teams from specialty hardline retailers (BBY, BJ, DG, DKS, FL, OLLI, RH, TGT, ULTA, WMT, WOOF) to assess tariff exposure, consumer behavior, and macroeconomic challenges amid 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and the average US tariff rate at its highest since the 1930s. 



Here are the conversations Kate McShane, Mark Jordan, and other analysts had with IR and management teams from retailers: 
Best Buy
Tariff exposure and impacts. Given President Trump&apos;s recent exclusion of electronics from tariffs, management noted that their exposure is likely even lower than the 20% remaining China tariff. BBY is still trying to figure out their tariff situation by talking to vendors, but noted that most of their COGS that originate from Mexico are under exclusion as well (leaving them at low exposure for Mexico). Management also emphasized that the tariff exposure to comp headwind correlation is not linear, as vendors have multiple sites of manufacturing and it is largely dependent on the trade offs vendors make. When comparing tariffs to 2018/2019, they noted that last time, tariffs came through on large appliances, and most of the product categories did not get hit much since they were also exempted. At the moment, management does not believe they have taken prices up (they anticipate tariffs impacting 2Q-4Q), and as of last earnings call, have not brought in any inventory early for tariffs.
Navigating consumer elasticity and macroenvironment. Management stated that their guidance takes into account their potential estimate for consumer elasticity, as they accounted for factors such as product levels, vendor price increases, potential declines in purchased units, etc. They are also involved in weekly planning given the macro-environment, and are preparing themselves and their vendors to be ready in case of any quick tariff changes. In the case of a recession, management noted that there are still many levers they could move to preserve profitability, such as changing labor demand and reducing various SG&amp;A expenses.
BJ&apos;s Wholesale Club
BJ could benefit as a limited SKU retailer when it comes to tariffs. General merchandise comprises less than 15% of BJ&apos;s overall business. Management explained that BJ&apos;s limited SKU count and reliance on a treasure hunt experience gives the company more flexibility than some others. For example, BJ could forgo certain SKUs and offset that with other SKUs, making calculated choices depending on the situation.
BJ expects to see SG&amp;A deleverage this year but automation helps offset. On the 4Q earnings call, BJ guided to SG&amp;A deleverage, driven by an acceleration in new club openings, particularly with continued outsized growth in depreciation as the company owns more of the clubs its opens. BJ plans to be disciplined from an overall cost perspective. Management also noted that the use of automation, such as autonomous robots in inventory, can help minimize footsteps and labor hours, allowing for more labor hours to go towards customer-facing tasks.
Dollar General
Improved execution leading to trade-in. In their last earnings call, DG noted that the trade-down between higher income consumers has been accelerating between 4Q and 1Q. Management noted that the reason they didn&apos;t see this trade-down earlier is likely due to some consumers taking a little longer to feel pressure, but also because of improved company execution. DG believes they are in a better spot today to receive trade-down needs than they were 6-9 months ago, which will allow them to create better impacts on their trade-in customers. Specifically, management noted that they are better positioned in their in-stock levels, SKU reduction strategies, and are investing more in their back-to-basics, which is translating to the top line.
No significant changes on SNAP. Management stated that they are watching SNAP carefully and believes that the low income consumer is still under pressure, but has not confirmed any significant changes related to SNAP. They noted that in the past they have seen significant impacts when there are full-scale cuts on SNAP, but it is not as impacted when it is only work requirement changes. They also stated that if there were certain foods removed from SNAP, they would likely see more of a gradual impact than immediate, given that the consumer will not stop buying the foods they regularly eat immediately. Currently, SNAP accounts for ~MSD of DG&apos;s sales.
DICK&apos;S Sporting Goods
DKS&apos;s position in a difficult macro backdrop. Per management, DKS is uniquely positioned in the marketplace, especially during challenging times, as its offering enables people to go outside and manage stress in an accessible way. Additionally, people are not willing to forgo things they consider essential, such as cleats that fit their kids or running shoes, which they often view as more necessary than discretionary. In terms of Game Changer, management highlighted that it has become an indispensable piece of the youth sports ecosystem and remains confident in the business in a tougher macroeconomic environment.
The company could benefit from elevated inventory. Exiting 4Q, DKS&apos;s inventory was up 18%, more for other reasons (e.g., its Southern store strategy, strategic investments) versus getting ahead of tariffs. As a result, there could be some unintended benefits from the higher inventory. The inventory consists of some seasonal and some core product, and it was a focused investment into certain brands categories that have been fueling top line growth to keep the momentum going.
Foot Locker
FL&apos;s tariff exposure. FL&apos;s private label is a LSD percent of sales, with about half of that being sourced through China and the balance through other Southeast Asian countries. FL&apos;s partners also have exposure to China, while noting their exposure to that region has come down over the past several years, particularly following 2018/19 tariffs. Per management, the company is working through this with their partners through a lens of mutual profitability. FL noted that their outlook for the year still suggests that they will continue to make progress against their Lace Up plan.
FL noted its inventory was in a good place coming out of 4Q. FL&apos;s inventory levels were up 1% coming out of 4Q, and the company saw improved inventory turns last year. Per management, FL wants to leave some flexibility to lean into any traffic-driving promotions, rather than needing to clear inventory. In terms of inventory management, FL plans to continue to be agile and respond to the overall macro environment.
Ollie&apos;s Bargain Outlet
Supply chain opportunity and flexibility in the current environment. Management addressed investor concerns that supply chain opportunities could be limited in the near term if tariffs persist, by noting that OLLI has already factored that into their strategies, and is continuing to aggressively buy product. In the case that supply chain products are limited, management is not worried given that there is still a lot of merchandise from distressed stores and bankruptcies. While they have not currently seen mass cancellations of orders yet, they highlighted that once more imports arrive from China, companies will have to start canceling orders, likely allowing OLLI to benefit from this excess merchandise.

Given OLLI does not have a set planogram merchandise model, consumers are not expecting them to have the same products every time, which allows OLLI&apos;s buyers to flexibly chase different products.

RH plans to work through its elevated inventory which will help with FCF. RH has $200-300mn in excess inventory, with the company noting it bought heavily in advance into its new collections which were trending well. RH plans to work through the inventory this year, without providing a timeline on when this will be done. The company is not buying as much unless it is new collections (i.e., new items in its sourcebooks) or for customers&apos; custom orders.
While the macro remains challenging, RH seeks to benefit from newness. RH sees an impact on its customer base when mortgage rates go above 7%. In terms of correlation with the stock market, wealthy customers might wait and not purchase in a certain month, and in general, the company sees a correlation between mortgage rates and existing home sales. Per management, RH set out to gain market share with newness, noting that from 2019-22, the company did not offer newness. RH noted it is currently benefiting from the transformation through market share gains, given its compelling offering, scale, and pricing.
Levers RH could pull in a difficult environment. RH noted it could potentially monetize assets through sale leasebacks, which it has done in the past. The company added that its marketing spend is over $100mn, which it could cut back on, along with salaries, corporate headcount, or ongoing projects/investments. RH pointed to its 4/6/20 press release (linked here) as an example of what it has done historically.
Target
Prices will likely increase, while elasticity is hard to predict. In terms of direct exposure to China, private label is 30% of sales, and 30% of their private label comes from China. Direct imports are more in home and apparel, while indirect is more of electronics and toys.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harvard has refused to accept the orders of a Trump administration commission concerning its chronic problems with anti-Semitism, campus violence, and racial tribalism, bias, and segregation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-21_08-50-35.jpg?itok=KrYaoUb9&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-21_08-50-35.jpg?itok=KrYaoUb9&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;77c7a1d7-54fe-4e3f-91ea-3d5bc15597f6&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;282&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-21_08-50-35.jpg?itok=KrYaoUb9&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, unlike some conservative campuses that distrust an overbearing Washington, Harvard and most elite schools like it want it both ways. They do as they please on their own turf and yet still demand that the taxpayers send them multibillion-dollar checks in addition to their multibillion-dollar private incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside from the issues of autonomy and free expression, there are lots of campus practices that higher education would prefer were not widely known to the public.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But soon they will be, and thus will become sources of public anger. Perhaps envision elite private colleges as mossy rocks, which seem outwardly picturesque—until you turn them over and see what crawls beneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if there are protracted standoffs, our elite campuses will be hard-pressed to defend the indefensible. This effort will be difficult because public confidence in higher education has already plummeted to historic lows in the most recent polls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Amerispeak public surveys, those expressing very little confidence or none at all in higher education have soared to about 30 percent of respondents, while those polling only “some” confidence rose to 40%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polls show that less than a third of Americans have quite a lot of confidence in our college campuses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wonder: Over the past half-century, tuition has generally risen at twice the rate of inflation. In part, that price-gouging became standard because federal aid to our most prestigious schools has skyrocketed, hand-in-glove with the federalized student loan program. It has become a $1.7 trillion entity in which the combined rate of both those students who defaulted on their guaranteed loans or are currently late on payments is nearing 12-13 percent. In sum, colleges counted on an ensured stream of tuition money and so raised their prices inordinately, given federal guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that small private Hillsdale College, which takes no federal money and is the guarantor of its own generous student aid, charges about $45,000-50,000 for combined tuition, room, and board—about half the going rate in the Ivy League and similar elite campuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Half the youth of the country who choose to go straight to work and not attend college might object to such use of their tax dollars. &lt;/strong&gt;They would assume that universities with multibillion-dollar endowments and huge annual incomes have plenty of resources to guarantee their own student loans. That way, campuses would have a financial interest in seeing their own students graduate in four years, get jobs, and pay back their alma mater promptly and fully. Instead, as long as universities are paid upfront, they seem to care little that their graduates leave heavily in debt and occasionally default on their loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is almost no intellectual diversity on campus. &lt;/strong&gt;Some recent studies have found Democrat/liberal professors outnumber their Republican/conservative counterparts by a 10-1 margin, especially in the social sciences and humanities. There are plenty of conservative PhDs on the market, but higher education has used insidious methods such as diversity oaths and covert political bias to find ways not to hire or retain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colleges no longer believe in their ancient mission to teach students the ancient, disinterested, and inductive method of pursuing knowledge. Nor do they care much that their graduates leave college without a broad classical education in history, literature, language, philosophy, science, and math. Instead, they are missionaries who believe their duty is to indoctrinate youth in progressive ideology, found mostly in studies courses and deductive classes, as part of a greater project to fundamentally alter the nature of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supreme Court in a recent case ruled against Harvard and the University of North Carolina, stating that their use of racial and gender bias is illegal under the 14th Amendment and thus affirmative action and associated racial essentialism are forbidden.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, many of our campuses simply rebrand their offices of “diversity/equity/inclusion” —the campus euphemism for using race and gender bias in applications, hiring, retention, and promotion—with newer Orwellian names like the “Office of Belonging” or “Community Outreach.” Universities are higher education’s version of sanctuary cities that likewise cavalierly believe they can largely ignore federal laws with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example, it’s illegal to segregate university events or facilities by race. But universities sidestep the law by offering race-based graduation ceremonies as “auxiliary” or “additional” events and commemorations. &lt;/strong&gt;Racially segregated dorms are deemed “theme” houses open to all but de facto widely known as racially exclusive. If the so-called “white” minority at Stanford—some 22 percent of the student body—opted for an “extra” white graduation ceremony, theoretically open to all students, the university would—and should—shut it down promptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In business and private entities, “overhead deductions” or “surcharges” usually run from 10 to 20 percent. But elite private universities charge the federal government for their faculty research grants, often between 40 and 60 percent. Apparently, they operate on the principle that their supposedly prestigious brands deserve private exemption from gouging the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, foreign governments, without audit, have poured some $60 billion into America’s purportedly most prestigious universities. Communist China and illiberal Qatar alone gave $500 million last year. And they expect and receive something for their ideologically driven investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Education during the first Trump administration fined many campuses millions of dollars for not reporting these often quid pro quo gifts. &lt;strong&gt;If one wonders why hundreds of thousands of foreign students from dictatorial and often anti-American nations like China and Middle Eastern autocracies prove instrumental in growing anti-American and anti-Israel protests, then follow the money that funds professorships and programs sympathetic to these agendas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bill of Rights and its later amendments apply to everyone everywhere in the United States. But these laws are especially operative on those entities that take federal government money and, by doing so, forfeit some of their operational autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yet disruptions of invited lecturers who are conservative, pro-Israeli, pro-life, or who question biological males competing in female sports are commonplace on campus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, when an invited conservative federal judge, a Republican officeholder, a traditionalist activist, or a professor deemed not conservative is shouted down, or the lecture hall is swarmed with disruptive and sometimes violent student protestors, campus administrators issue pro forma stern statements about “not tolerating violations of free speech.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then, they do nothing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most campus officials either empathize with the spirit or the ideology of the disrupters. Or they are far more afraid of their own radical professors and students than they are of the federal government cutting off their funding for refusing to guarantee First Amendment protections. Harvard arguing for federal funds on the principle of protecting the First Amendment is adding insult to the serial injury it has done to free speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More cynically, most campus administrators assume that if conservative pro-life students ever swarmed a pro-abortion lecturer, or Jewish students ransacked a Middle East Studies classroom or chased and then trapped foreign students in a library, then they would likely be summarily expelled. Most naturally assume that universities’ selective timidity and laxity are ideologically and politically driven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no guarantee of due process on campus, as understood under the Bill of Rights. Students or faculty who are accused of particular hot-button “crimes,” such as sexual harassment or “hate speech,” are often denied the right to know their accusers or to have an open hearing with legal counsel before a disinterested panel of judges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The wronged have little redress of grievance except to use the public court system to intervene to force the university to follow the law.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best-kept secret of our marquee universities is a radical fall-off in standards as once defined by their own, once much ballyhooed, tough requirements. Our best universities customarily now ensure that 70-80 percent of students in their classes receive A’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prestigious campuses, like Harvard and Stanford, have recently introduced remedial math classes. &lt;/strong&gt;Privately, the supposedly most demanding campuses know that their prior non-meritocratic admissions have resulted in thousands of students who enter college without the high-school preparation necessary to meet their own past traditional university requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative, Jewish, and religious families now doubt whether their offspring would be treated equitably or would receive a first-rate education commensurate with the four-year total $400,000 cost, or are even now safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When pressed, universities usually point to their professional and graduate schools in medicine, engineering, math, science, and business as integral to American prosperity. True, they are. But to the degree they are, it is likely because they have either resisted university orthodoxy or were never as politicized as the social sciences and humanities, or are already being weaponized, albeit more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If universities were smart, they would accept federal conditions to follow the law and protect the safety and interests of their own students.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way, they would restore their academic rigor and reputations, regain public support, and enhance meritocracy, the key to their former excellence. But even if their officials are either too partisan or timid to change, they could always publicly report to their radical faculties and students that they were “forced” to comply with conditions that they might privately accept were certainly in their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Otherwise, at the present rate, employers, parents, and the public will make the necessary adjustments, and the brands once deemed the gold standard and prestigious will become mere dross.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Do Elite Universities Really Wish To Fight The Federal Government?

Like many young Canadians, Zorrilla is fed up - and &lt;strong&gt;he’s placing his hopes in Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre&lt;/strong&gt;, while the Liberal Party is seeking a fourth term after globalist Justin Trudeau was forced to take the L.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/AFP__20250109__36TF3L6__v1__HighRes__CanadaPoliticsPoilievre-1743532080.jpg?itok=GdGB_d89&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/AFP__20250109__36TF3L6__v1__HighRes__CanadaPoliticsPoilievre-1743532080.jpg?itok=GdGB_d89&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ddb07540-1861-4812-a708-137cac337eab&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/AFP__20250109__36TF3L6__v1__HighRes__CanadaPoliticsPoilievre-1743532080.jpg?itok=GdGB_d89&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Conservative Party of Canada [File: Dave Chan/AFP Photo]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;It’s time for a change&lt;/strong&gt;,” Zorrilla told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-17/canada-s-gen-z-voters-turn-to-conservative-poilievre-in-race-against-carney&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, heading into a Poilievre campaign stop near Vancouver. Though Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is out of the picture, Zorrilla isn’t buying the Liberals&apos; rebrand. “&lt;strong&gt;Still the same rock band&lt;/strong&gt;,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That frustration is bubbling over across Canada’s younger voters. Once wooed by promises of legalized pot and eco-friendly reforms, &lt;strong&gt;Millennials and Gen Z are now reeling from runaway housing prices and a cost-of-living crisis&lt;/strong&gt; that’s left dreams of home ownership and early retirement in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Poilievre has found resonance among the youth - &lt;strong&gt;roughly 39% of 18-to-34-year-olds back the Conservatives vs. 36% for the Liberals,&lt;/strong&gt; per &lt;a href=&quot;https://nanos.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-2783-ELXN-FED-2025-04-15_Field-Ended.pdf&quot;&gt;Nanos Research&lt;/a&gt;, not enough to catapult him ahead but still significant. With less than two weeks before election day, Prime Minister Mark Carney’s Liberals are holding a narrow lead overall, &lt;strong&gt;thanks in part to strong support from Canadian boomers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/nanos.JPG?itok=Oyw2YWui&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/nanos.JPG?itok=Oyw2YWui&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ffce3d63-7635-4822-afc9-b324ede74bfc&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;403&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/nanos.JPG?itok=Oyw2YWui&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carney, 60, is virtually a stranger to the TikTok generation. His political playbook caters more to Baby Boomers than Zoomers, like the ad where he and “Austin Powers” star Mike Myers wax nostalgic about Mr. Dressup and The Tragically Hip. Good luck finding a Gen Z’er who knows who Howie Meeker is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it’s that very throwback charm that’s roped in voters like Tracy Nice, a 64-year-old lifelong Conservative who flipped blue over Carney’s steady hand and Canada’s souring relationship with the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Carney just seems like a very smart, calm, thoughtful man who I trust&lt;/strong&gt;,” Nice said. “And obviously the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England trusted him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poilievre, meanwhile, has taken a different approach&lt;/strong&gt;. He’s leaned into the social media era, ditching stuffy suits for tight tees, donning aviators, and even puffing hookah with a shawarma shop owner on YouTube while chatting about cryptocurrency. His message? &lt;strong&gt;Axe taxes, cut red tape, and let Canadians save - all wrapped in a swagger that channels online populism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As Mark Jeftovic of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bombthrower.com/iconic-symbol-of-liberal-arrogance-goes-viral-for-the-wrong-reasons/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bombthrower.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes, Canadian boomers are generally dicks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The Liberal base has had it easy for a decade. With a compliant, sycophantic press and a loyal army of boomers—presumably the only ones still answering calls from pollsters on their wall-mounted rotary-dial landlines during CBC commercial breaks—they greet any resistance to the prospect of four more years of controlled demolition of the Canadian economy with smugness and derision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it&apos;s no mystery why young men are flocking to the Conservatives - though the gender gap is hard to ignore. Twice as many women support Carney’s Liberals, while nearly half of male voters back Poilievre. Liberals were quick to pounce on the Tory leader’s use of the phrase “biological clock” during a speech on housing affordability, accusing him of tone-deafness on gender issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Poilievre’s style is coded masculine&lt;/strong&gt;,” said Laura Stephenson, a political science professor at Western University. “&lt;strong&gt;And the Conservative Party in general... has often been favored by men over women.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the youth surge behind Poilievre marks a generational reversal. Traditionally, young Canadians leaned left, while older voters skewed conservative. Now, with sky-high rents and stalled economic growth, the Liberal record is falling flat — even as the party racks up wins on progressive policies like pharmacare and dental care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have legalized marijuana, we have pharmacare, we have dental care,” said Stephenson. “What many [young voters] still struggle with, though, is paying rent, or buying a home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, for Poilievre, may be his most potent talking point yet. Whether it’s enough to close the gap before voters hit the polls,&lt;strong&gt; that’s the billion-dollar question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>&quot;It&apos;s Time For A Change&quot;: Canadian Youth Fed Up, Turn To Conservative Poilievre As Liberal Boomers Go Full Carney

            
It was a rainy March evening in British Columbia, but that didn’t stop 29-year-old Giancarlo Zorrilla from attending his first political rally. Like many young Canadians, Zorrilla is fed up - and he’s placing his hopes in Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, while the Liberal Party is seeking a fourth term after globalist Justin Trudeau was forced to take the L.

“It’s time for a change,” Zorrilla told Bloomberg, heading into a Poilievre campaign stop near Vancouver. Though Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is out of the picture, Zorrilla isn’t buying the Liberals&apos; rebrand. “Still the same rock band,” he quipped.
That frustration is bubbling over across Canada’s younger voters. Once wooed by promises of legalized pot and eco-friendly reforms, Millennials and Gen Z are now reeling from runaway housing prices and a cost-of-living crisis that’s left dreams of home ownership and early retirement in the dust.
While Poilievre has found resonance among the youth - roughly 39% of 18-to-34-year-olds back the Conservatives vs. 36% for the Liberals, per Nanos Research, not enough to catapult him ahead but still significant. With less than two weeks before election day, Prime Minister Mark Carney’s Liberals are holding a narrow lead overall, thanks in part to strong support from Canadian boomers.



Carney, 60, is virtually a stranger to the TikTok generation. His political playbook caters more to Baby Boomers than Zoomers, like the ad where he and “Austin Powers” star Mike Myers wax nostalgic about Mr. Dressup and The Tragically Hip. Good luck finding a Gen Z’er who knows who Howie Meeker is.
Yet it’s that very throwback charm that’s roped in voters like Tracy Nice, a 64-year-old lifelong Conservative who flipped blue over Carney’s steady hand and Canada’s souring relationship with the U.S.
“Carney just seems like a very smart, calm, thoughtful man who I trust,” Nice said. “And obviously the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England trusted him.”
Poilievre, meanwhile, has taken a different approach. He’s leaned into the social media era, ditching stuffy suits for tight tees, donning aviators, and even puffing hookah with a shawarma shop owner on YouTube while chatting about cryptocurrency. His message? Axe taxes, cut red tape, and let Canadians save - all wrapped in a swagger that channels online populism.
As Mark Jeftovic of Bombthrower.com notes, Canadian boomers are generally dicks:
The Liberal base has had it easy for a decade. With a compliant, sycophantic press and a loyal army of boomers—presumably the only ones still answering calls from pollsters on their wall-mounted rotary-dial landlines during CBC commercial breaks—they greet any resistance to the prospect of four more years of controlled demolition of the Canadian economy with smugness and derision.
There are endless cases caught on video of deranged elderly liberals gyrating in spasmodic fashion chanting “elbows up” at each other and the rest of us and they seem to think it’s some kind of “gotcha moment” to fly off the handle or flip us the bird…

      <title>Vatican Countdown: Here Are The Candidates For New Pope </title>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Vatican Countdown: Here Are The Candidates For New Pope &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (1628ET): &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pope Francis&apos; death earlier this morning triggered centuries-old traditions and rules within the Roman Catholic Church, including mourning and the selection of a new leader. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the key steps in selecting the new pope: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vacancy of the Papal See:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The process begins when the papacy becomes vacant, typically due to the death of the reigning pope or, more rarely, resignation (e.g., Pope Benedict XVI in 2013).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Camerlengo, a cardinal appointed to manage the Church&apos;s temporal affairs during the vacancy, verifies the pope&apos;s death (historically by tapping the forehead and calling his baptismal name) and assumes interim administrative duties.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation for the Conclave:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The College of Cardinals gathers in Rome for General Congregations, daily meetings to handle Church business and prepare for the conclave. These meetings include all cardinals, but only those under 80 years old can vote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The conclave must begin 15–20 days after the vacancy, allowing time for cardinals to travel, though this can be adjusted slightly. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sistine Chapel is prepared as the voting venue, secured to ensure secrecy, with electronic jamming devices to prevent leaks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Conclave:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eligible Voters: Only cardinals under 80 years old at the start of the vacancy can participate (maximum 120 electors, though the number varies; currently ~130 eligible cardinals exist, per Vatican estimates). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seclusion: Cardinals are sequestered in the Domus Sanctae Marthae (a Vatican residence) and the Sistine Chapel, swearing oaths of secrecy. No external communication is allowed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voting Process: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voting occurs in the Sistine Chapel, with two rounds in the morning and two in the afternoon each day. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cardinals write a name on a ballot, fold it, and place it in a chalice, saying, &quot;I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A two-thirds majority (e.g., 80 of 120 votes) is required to elect a pope. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If no candidate achieves this, the ballots are burned with a chemical to produce black smoke (indicating no decision). If a candidate secures two-thirds, the ballots are burned to produce white smoke, signaling a new pope.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrutiny and Counting: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three scrutineers (elected cardinals) count votes, with infirmarii collecting ballots from any sick cardinals. Ballots are burned after each session.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadlock Provisions: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;After ~13 days (33–34 ballots) without a two-thirds majority, cardinals may vote to reduce the requirement to a simple majority or hold a runoff between the top two candidates (per Universi Dominici Gregis).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance and Announcement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If elected, the candidate is asked by the Dean of the College of Cardinals: &quot;Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?&quot; and, if yes, &quot;By what name will you be called?&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new pope chooses a papal name (e.g., John Paul, Francis) and is vested in papal garments. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cardinal Protodeacon announces &quot;Habemus Papam&quot; (&quot;We have a pope&quot;) from the balcony of St. Peter&apos;s Basilica, introducing the new pope&apos;s name and title. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pope imparts the Urbi et Orbi blessing to the crowd in St. Peter&apos;s Square.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are the contenders to be the next pope (list courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://succeed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pietro Parolin, 70, Italy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seen as a moderate &quot;continuity candidate&quot;, Parolin was close to Francis. He has been the Vatican&apos;s secretary of state since 2013, playing a key role in diplomatic affairs, including delicate negotiations with China and governments in the Middle East. He is regarded as a reliable and trusted papal representative by secular diplomats. In 2018, he was the driving force behind a controversial agreement with the Chinese government on the appointment of bishops, criticised by some as a sellout to the communist regime. Parolin&apos;s critics see him as a modernist and a pragmatist who places ideology and diplomatic solutions above hard truths of the faith. To his supporters, he is a courageous idealist and avid proponent of peace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luis Antonio Tagle, 67, the Philippines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tagle, a former archbishop of Manila, would be the first Asian pope, the region with the fastest-growing Catholic population. At one time he was considered to be Francis&apos;s preferred successor and a strong contender to continue the late pope&apos;s progressive agenda, but recently appears to have fallen out of favour. He has suggested that the Catholic church&apos;s stance on gay and divorced couples is too harsh, but has opposed abortion rights in the Philippines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Turkson, 76, Ghana&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turkson would be the first black pope in centuries. He has been vocal on issues such the climate crisis, poverty and economic justice while affirming the church&apos;s traditional positions on the priesthood, marriage between a man and a woman, and homosexuality. However, his views on the latter have loosened and he has argued that laws in many African countries are too harsh. He has spoken out on corruption and human rights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Péter Erdő, 72, Hungary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leading conservative candidate, Erdő has been a strong advocate for traditional Catholic teachings and doctrine. He would represent a big shift away from Francis&apos;s approach. He is widely regarded as a great intellect and a man of culture. Erdő was a favourite of the late cardinal George Pell who believed he would restore the rule of law in the post-Francis Vatican. In 2015, Erdő appeared to align himself with Hungary&apos;s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, when he opposed Francis&apos;s call for churches to take in migrants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matteo Zuppi, 69, Italy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appointed a cardinal by Francis in 2019, Zuppi is considered to be on the progressive wing of the church, and would be expected to continue Francis&apos;s legacy, sharing the late pope&apos;s concern for the poor and marginalised. He is (relatively) liberal on same-sex relationships. Two years ago, Francis made him the Vatican peace envoy for Ukraine, in which capacity he visited Moscow to &quot;encourage gestures of humanity&quot;. While there he met Patriarch Kirill, the leader of the Russian Orthodox church and Vladimir Putin&apos;s ally. He has also met Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine&apos;s president.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;José Tolentino Calaça de Mendonça, 59, Portugal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tolentino is one of the youngest potential successors to Francis, which could count against him – ambitious cardinals may not want to wait another 20 or 30 years before another shot at the top job. He has attracted controversy for sympathising with tolerant views on same-sex relationships and allying himself with a feminist Benedictine sister who favours women&apos;s ordination and is pro-choice. He was close to Francis on most issues, and argues that the church must engage with modern culture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mario Grech, 68, Malta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grech was seen as a traditionalist but began to embrace more progressive views after Francis was elected in 2013. His supporters argue that his changing opinions show his capacity for growth and change. He has criticised European political leaders who sought to limit the activities of NGO ships and has expressed support for female deacons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, Italy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since 2020, Pizzaballa has been the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, a crucial role in advocating for the Christian minority in the Holy Land. After Hamas&apos;s attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, Pizzaballa offered himself as a hostage in exchange for children who were being held by Hamas in Gaza. He visited Gaza in May 2024 after months of negotiations. He would be expected to continue some aspects of Francis&apos;s leadership of the church, but has made few public statements on controversial issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Sarah, 79, Guinea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarah is a traditional, Orthodox cardinal who at one time sought to present himself as a &quot;parallel authority&quot; to Francis, according to a Vatican observer. In 2020, he co-authored a book with the then retired Pope Benedict defending clerical celibacy that was seen as a challenge to Francis&apos;s authority. He has denounced &quot;gender ideology&quot; as a threat to society, and has spoken out against Islamic fundamentalism. Like Turkson, he could make history as the first black pope in centuries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vatican News reports that Pope Francis died at the age of 88 at 7:35 a.m. local time (1:35 a.m. EST). Earlier this year, he experienced a severe health crisis that resulted in over a month of hospitalization due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/medical/pope-franciss-condition-worsens-after-respiratory-crisis-vatican&quot;&gt;double pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2025-04/pope-francis-dies-on-easter-monday-aged-88.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the death of the 266th pope via this statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Dearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis. At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favor of the poorest and most marginalized. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vatican News provided more color on the Pope&apos;s deteriorating health leading up to his death on Easter Monday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pope was admitted to the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital on Friday, February 14, 2025, after suffering from a bout of bronchitis for several days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pope Francis&apos; clinical situation gradually worsened, and his doctors diagnosed bilateral pneumonia on Tuesday, February 18.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After 38 days in hospital, the late Pope returned to his Vatican residence at the Casa Santa Marta to continue his recovery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To his 1.3 billion followers, Francis signaled a more inclusive stance toward LGBTQ+ Catholics and advocated for open borders in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis was the first pope from Latin America, the first Jesuit to become the head of the Catholic Church, and the first to take the name Francis, inspired by St. Francis of Assisi, who gave up his vast amounts of wealth to live in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout his tenure (March 13, 2013 to April 21, 2025), Francis also spoke about multiple recurring themes, including compassion, humility, and advocacy. He told followers, &quot;My people are poor, and I am one of them.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance met with Francis to exchange Easter greetings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know you have not been feeling great, but it&apos;s good to see you in better health,&quot; Vance told the Pope, adding, &quot;Thank you for seeing me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Vatican Countdown: Here Are The Candidates For New Pope 

            
Update (1628ET): 
Pope Francis&apos; death earlier this morning triggered centuries-old traditions and rules within the Roman Catholic Church, including mourning and the selection of a new leader. 
Here are the key steps in selecting the new pope: 
Vacancy of the Papal See:

	
The process begins when the papacy becomes vacant, typically due to the death of the reigning pope or, more rarely, resignation (e.g., Pope Benedict XVI in 2013).
The Camerlengo, a cardinal appointed to manage the Church&apos;s temporal affairs during the vacancy, verifies the pope&apos;s death (historically by tapping the forehead and calling his baptismal name) and assumes interim administrative duties.
Preparation for the Conclave:

	
The College of Cardinals gathers in Rome for General Congregations, daily meetings to handle Church business and prepare for the conclave. These meetings include all cardinals, but only those under 80 years old can vote.
The conclave must begin 15–20 days after the vacancy, allowing time for cardinals to travel, though this can be adjusted slightly. 
The Sistine Chapel is prepared as the voting venue, secured to ensure secrecy, with electronic jamming devices to prevent leaks.
The Conclave:

	
Eligible Voters: Only cardinals under 80 years old at the start of the vacancy can participate (maximum 120 electors, though the number varies; currently ~130 eligible cardinals exist, per Vatican estimates). 
Seclusion: Cardinals are sequestered in the Domus Sanctae Marthae (a Vatican residence) and the Sistine Chapel, swearing oaths of secrecy. No external communication is allowed.
Voting Process: 

	
Voting occurs in the Sistine Chapel, with two rounds in the morning and two in the afternoon each day. 
Cardinals write a name on a ballot, fold it, and place it in a chalice, saying, &quot;I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge.&quot; 
A two-thirds majority (e.g., 80 of 120 votes) is required to elect a pope. 
If no candidate achieves this, the ballots are burned with a chemical to produce black smoke (indicating no decision). If a candidate secures two-thirds, the ballots are burned to produce white smoke, signaling a new pope.
Scrutiny and Counting: 
Three scrutineers (elected cardinals) count votes, with infirmarii collecting ballots from any sick cardinals. Ballots are burned after each session.
Deadlock Provisions: 
After ~13 days (33–34 ballots) without a two-thirds majority, cardinals may vote to reduce the requirement to a simple majority or hold a runoff between the top two candidates (per Universi Dominici Gregis).
Acceptance and Announcement:

	
If elected, the candidate is asked by the Dean of the College of Cardinals: &quot;Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?&quot; and, if yes, &quot;By what name will you be called?&quot; 
The new pope chooses a papal name (e.g., John Paul, Francis) and is vested in papal garments. 
The Cardinal Protodeacon announces &quot;Habemus Papam&quot; (&quot;We have a pope&quot;) from the balcony of St. Peter&apos;s Basilica, introducing the new pope&apos;s name and title. 
The pope imparts the Urbi et Orbi blessing to the crowd in St. Peter&apos;s Square.


Who are the contenders to be the next pope (list courtesy of The Guardian):
Pietro Parolin, 70, Italy
Seen as a moderate &quot;continuity candidate&quot;, Parolin was close to Francis. He has been the Vatican&apos;s secretary of state since 2013, playing a key role in diplomatic affairs, including delicate negotiations with China and governments in the Middle East. He is regarded as a reliable and trusted papal representative by secular diplomats. In 2018, he was the driving force behind a controversial agreement with the Chinese government on the appointment of bishops, criticised by some as a sellout to the communist regime. Parolin&apos;s critics see him as a modernist and a pragmatist who places ideology and diplomatic solutions above hard truths of the faith. To his supporters, he is a courageous idealist and avid proponent of peace.
Luis Antonio Tagle, 67, the Philippines
Tagle, a former archbishop of Manila, would be the first Asian pope, the region with the fastest-growing Catholic population. At one time he was considered to be Francis&apos;s preferred successor and a strong contender to continue the late pope&apos;s progressive agenda, but recently appears to have fallen out of favour. He has suggested that the Catholic church&apos;s stance on gay and divorced couples is too harsh, but has opposed abortion rights in the Philippines.
Peter Turkson, 76, Ghana
Turkson would be the first black pope in centuries. He has been vocal on issues such the climate crisis, poverty and economic justice while affirming the church&apos;s traditional positions on the priesthood, marriage between a man and a woman, and homosexuality. However, his views on the latter have loosened and he has argued that laws in many African countries are too harsh. He has spoken out on corruption and human rights.
Péter Erdő, 72, Hungary
A leading conservative candidate, Erdő has been a strong advocate for traditional Catholic teachings and doctrine. He would represent a big shift away from Francis&apos;s approach. He is widely regarded as a great intellect and a man of culture. Erdő was a favourite of the late cardinal George Pell who believed he would restore the rule of law in the post-Francis Vatican. In 2015, Erdő appeared to align himself with Hungary&apos;s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, when he opposed Francis&apos;s call for churches to take in migrants.
Matteo Zuppi, 69, Italy
Appointed a cardinal by Francis in 2019, Zuppi is considered to be on the progressive wing of the church, and would be expected to continue Francis&apos;s legacy, sharing the late pope&apos;s concern for the poor and marginalised. He is (relatively) liberal on same-sex relationships. Two years ago, Francis made him the Vatican peace envoy for Ukraine, in which capacity he visited Moscow to &quot;encourage gestures of humanity&quot;. While there he met Patriarch Kirill, the leader of the Russian Orthodox church and Vladimir Putin&apos;s ally. He has also met Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine&apos;s president.
José Tolentino Calaça de Mendonça, 59, Portugal
Tolentino is one of the youngest potential successors to Francis, which could count against him – ambitious cardinals may not want to wait another 20 or 30 years before another shot at the top job. He has attracted controversy for sympathising with tolerant views on same-sex relationships and allying himself with a feminist Benedictine sister who favours women&apos;s ordination and is pro-choice. He was close to Francis on most issues, and argues that the church must engage with modern culture.
Mario Grech, 68, Malta
Grech was seen as a traditionalist but began to embrace more progressive views after Francis was elected in 2013. His supporters argue that his changing opinions show his capacity for growth and change. He has criticised European political leaders who sought to limit the activities of NGO ships and has expressed support for female deacons.
Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, Italy
Since 2020, Pizzaballa has been the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, a crucial role in advocating for the Christian minority in the Holy Land. After Hamas&apos;s attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, Pizzaballa offered himself as a hostage in exchange for children who were being held by Hamas in Gaza. He visited Gaza in May 2024 after months of negotiations. He would be expected to continue some aspects of Francis&apos;s leadership of the church, but has made few public statements on controversial issues.
Robert Sarah, 79, Guinea
Sarah is a traditional, Orthodox cardinal who at one time sought to present himself as a &quot;parallel authority&quot; to Francis, according to a Vatican observer. In 2020, he co-authored a book with the then retired Pope Benedict defending clerical celibacy that was seen as a challenge to Francis&apos;s authority. He has denounced &quot;gender ideology&quot; as a threat to society, and has spoken out against Islamic fundamentalism. Like Turkson, he could make history as the first black pope in centuries.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great consternation boils and bubbles across the land as the sinister forces of Jacobin lawfare keep up their legalistic battery against the nation. You better believe that the country will not stand for much more of this lunatic judicial coup aimed at wrecking the authority of law itself, and with that, any chance for sane management of our affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, the activist org Indivisible, sponsored by Linked-In billionaire Reid Hoffman and dark money “pass through” funder the Tides Foundation (Bill Gates and others), sent its “protest” troops into the streets to pretend that there is public support for national suicide. &lt;strong&gt;It was a pitiful showing, after all. There are only so many mind-fucked Boomers out there who can be marshaled to militate for the psychopathocracy behind these monied actors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easter weekend looked like a turning point in this struggle for sanity over the public interest. On Saturday night, the SCOTUS shot its wad staying the deportation of Venezuelan gang-bangers rounded-up by ICE in Texas. Do you suppose that means the executive branch is powerless now to remove anyone who entered the USA illegally? It’s alleged that the illegal aliens have a right to some &lt;em&gt;due process&lt;/em&gt; beyond their deportation orders — which themselves entail sufficient due process to execute their removal, since entering the country illegally is an actionable violation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, millions of illegal immigrants ditched their own identity documents before crossing into the USA, so there is no way of even establishing who they actually are, were they to appear in an American court for any proposed &lt;em&gt;due process&lt;/em&gt; sorting-out. The identity erasure was carried out deliberately to confound the law, and was part of the concerted efforts of NGOs working with the “Joe Biden” regime to stuff illegals into the country as fast as possible with no vetting whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was, you understand, an elaborately engineered operation, down to the CPB One cell phone app created by the US Department of Homeland Security itself under Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to mass produce phony asylum cases that streamlined illegal entry for millions. &lt;/strong&gt;This was complemented by the DHS program of “humanitarian parole and travel authorization” to enter the US on commercial flights directly from foreign countries, bypassing customs interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivation for all that was understood by anyone with a functional brain: to assemble a new voter cohort, using motor-voter procedures and mail-in ballots to guarantee Democratic Party election victories in key districts for all time to come. It couldn’t have been more cynically corrupt, as is the new campaign to prevent these millions of new fake voters from being deported back to where they came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this points to the question: what can be done about such an arrant insult to the citizens of our country? The consternation arises from the failure of federal appeals courts, and now even the SCOTUS, to end the coup. What’s needed is a raft of major DOJ prosecutions for the serious crimes around the vast panoply of lawfare operations going back to 2016. I believe they are coming and that the reason you hear nothing lately out of the DOJ and the FBI is because the cases are under construction and details about them have not been leaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good place to start would be a case for mass murder, battery, obstruction of justice, and lying to Congress against the people responsible for the Covid-19 caper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed last week — though &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and the cable news networks didn’t report it — that the White House issued a major document titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/?s=01&quot;&gt;Lab Leak; the True Origins of Covid 19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The doc succinctly outlines the case that Anthony Fauci of NIAID and Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina presided over the design of the Covid-19 virus and outsourced its production, with the help of Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance, to the Wuhan Virology Institute lab. Include the CEOs or Pfizer and Moderna, Francis Collins, Rochelle Walensky, and their chief deputies at CDC, and Stephen Hahn, Janet Woodcock, and Robert Califf all serially chiefs of the FDA from 2020 to 2024, for enabling the phony and harmful Covid Vaccine program. Indict them all. Let a jury decide if Dr. Fauci’s preemptive pardon was legitimate. The others enjoy no pardon protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring cases against, John Brennan, James Comey, and a long list of DOJ / FBI officials for the crimes around RussiaGate. &lt;/strong&gt;Include Judge James “Jeb” Boasberg for his activities running the FISA court during the period. Indict them under federal statute 18 USC 371, Conspiracy to Defraud the United States. Throw in sedition and possibly treason, since the UK’s MI6 agency was a party to the seditious frauds involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indict Alejandro Mayorkas &lt;/strong&gt;and his deputies, and the White House aides manipulating “Joe Biden,” for engineering the mass entry of illegal immigrants between January 2021 and 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring cases against Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party leadership for instigating the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol building, as well as the DNC / RNC pipe bomb hoax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigate the previously ignored incidents of voter fraud in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Georgia in the 2020 election.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indict Joe Biden and his family for bribery and treason for their money laundering activities in Ukraine, China, Kazakhstan and elsewhere during Biden’s years as vice-president and the period when he was out-of-office, 2017 to 2021 (and enjoyed no immunity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indict Norm Eisen, Mary McCord, Andrew Weissmann, and Lisa Monaco for organizing the malicious prosecutions of Donald Trump in 2024 in Georgia, Florida, the District of Columbia, and New York City. And bring a case against Eisen and his assistants for orchestrating the current judicial coup outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start making this happen, Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, and you will begin to shatter the giant glass cloche of cognitive dissonance that holds the minds of half the country hostage to a long-running Jacobin conspiracy aimed at wrecking the country.&lt;/strong&gt; You will at least witness a startling shift in what the people pay attention to. Call it retribution if you like. It represents payback for a host of crimes committed against the American people by government officials who warred against them. It is well-deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>The Great Consternation

            
Authored by James Howard Kunstler,
&quot;Due process is when only one side has to follow the law and if you point out that this is a suicidal standard you’re a fascist”
- Auron MacIntyre
A great consternation boils and bubbles across the land as the sinister forces of Jacobin lawfare keep up their legalistic battery against the nation. You better believe that the country will not stand for much more of this lunatic judicial coup aimed at wrecking the authority of law itself, and with that, any chance for sane management of our affairs.



On Saturday, the activist org Indivisible, sponsored by Linked-In billionaire Reid Hoffman and dark money “pass through” funder the Tides Foundation (Bill Gates and others), sent its “protest” troops into the streets to pretend that there is public support for national suicide. It was a pitiful showing, after all. There are only so many mind-fucked Boomers out there who can be marshaled to militate for the psychopathocracy behind these monied actors.
Easter weekend looked like a turning point in this struggle for sanity over the public interest. On Saturday night, the SCOTUS shot its wad staying the deportation of Venezuelan gang-bangers rounded-up by ICE in Texas. Do you suppose that means the executive branch is powerless now to remove anyone who entered the USA illegally? It’s alleged that the illegal aliens have a right to some due process beyond their deportation orders — which themselves entail sufficient due process to execute their removal, since entering the country illegally is an actionable violation.
Of course, millions of illegal immigrants ditched their own identity documents before crossing into the USA, so there is no way of even establishing who they actually are, were they to appear in an American court for any proposed due process sorting-out. The identity erasure was carried out deliberately to confound the law, and was part of the concerted efforts of NGOs working with the “Joe Biden” regime to stuff illegals into the country as fast as possible with no vetting whatsoever.
It was, you understand, an elaborately engineered operation, down to the CPB One cell phone app created by the US Department of Homeland Security itself under Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to mass produce phony asylum cases that streamlined illegal entry for millions. This was complemented by the DHS program of “humanitarian parole and travel authorization” to enter the US on commercial flights directly from foreign countries, bypassing customs interviews.
The motivation for all that was understood by anyone with a functional brain: to assemble a new voter cohort, using motor-voter procedures and mail-in ballots to guarantee Democratic Party election victories in key districts for all time to come. It couldn’t have been more cynically corrupt, as is the new campaign to prevent these millions of new fake voters from being deported back to where they came from.

However, one bright spot emerged on X around midday: aerial images show that Cybercab prototype builds may have already begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Tegtmeyer, a certified flight instructor, snapped high-resolution aerial images of the Tesla Giga Texas earlier today, which revealed what could be castings of the new Cybercab vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting developments next to the Giga Texas Casting Machine section today … several new kinds of castings that do not look like Model Y or @cybertruck … looking for experts out there to identify these in the comments&lt;/strong&gt;!&quot; Tegtmeyer wrote on X. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla investor Sawyer Merritt &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1914382487809351796&quot;&gt;quoted&lt;/a&gt; Tegtmeyer&apos;s post on X, explaining:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;These do appear to be to rear Cybercab castings. The Cybertruck casting racks are marked with CTTX, which means Cybertruck Texas. On these new images from Joe today we can see RTTX, which likely means Robotaxi Texas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Tesla has been installing Cybercab production equipment for months. Two months ago in a public interview Lars Moravy said that the first Cybercab prototype builds were slated to start this summer, with general mass production to start in early 2026&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OblCcO7-Alg&quot;&gt;latest episode of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OblCcO7-Alg&quot;&gt;Club Random&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Bill Maher sat down with Turning Point USA founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/charliekirk11&quot;&gt;Charlie Kirk&lt;/a&gt; for what many expected to be a clash of political opposites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2827%29_5.jpg?itok=mvVd9vON&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2827%29_5.jpg?itok=mvVd9vON&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;6a09a25d-60bf-4ace-8550-537f63c065bf&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2827%29_5.jpg?itok=mvVd9vON&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what unfolded was something far more surprising: a candid, wide-ranging conversation that revealed just how much common ground these two actually share—especially when it comes to calling out the modern left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It kicked off with a sharp joke from Kirk, who warned &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/billmaher&quot;&gt;Maher&lt;/a&gt; that the “purple-hair jihadis” would be coming for him next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They want to kill me just as bad. Oh, they really do!” &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/billmaher&quot;&gt;Maher&lt;/a&gt; responded. He explained, “&lt;strong&gt;They hate their own apostates more&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m supposed to get on the short bus to crazy town with them—and I won’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, Maher began to draw a clear line between classic liberal values and what he called the “woke” ideology taking over the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am one of them! They’re not one of me,” he said. “Liberal and woke are two completely different things—woke is very often the opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher explained, “Liberalism is, &lt;strong&gt;let’s live in a colorblind society&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s the goal. Woke’s goal is, ‘&lt;strong&gt;We see race everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;.’ Liberal is, ‘There’s a two-state solution.’ Woke is ‘river to the sea.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came a line that cut to the core of his frustration: “&lt;strong&gt;You got off the F-train, you fell asleep, and you got off at 20 stops too far. Don’t blame me for that&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-media-max-width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;What started as a typical podcast on Club Random quickly turned into something way more revealing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/charliekirk11?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@charliekirk11&lt;/a&gt; and Bill Maher weren’t clashing on everything—they were connecting over one uncomfortable truth: the woke cult is tearing the country apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It began with a jab… &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wv4cEvOYIw&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/wv4cEvOYIw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation pivoted to an issue even some liberals are struggling to defend: women’s sports. Kirk praised Maher for speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You deserve credit for being a liberal that acknowledges male-female distinctions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, of course! Of all the low-lying fruit the Democrats just hand the Republicans to win elections, that’s the one,” Maher responded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk grinned and asked, “Are they really gonna let us win every national election on this no-men-in-women’s-sports thing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher answered bluntly: “It’s so ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He cited the stat that &lt;strong&gt;890 trophies had already gone to biological males competing in women’s events&lt;/strong&gt;—and even pointed out that California’s own Gavin Newsom had backed away from the debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You lost Gavin Newsom on this,” he said. “Take that as a hint.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I voted for Obama, I voted for Clinton,” Maher said. “But the idea that I could talk to them as freely as I felt this conversation was going, is &lt;strong&gt;emblematic to me of why the Democrats lose the elections&lt;/strong&gt;. Because they just don’t feel that this is like a real person.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He got even more honest: “And I know it’s so weird to say that about Donald Trump, who I’ve said a jillion times is, you know, a whiny little b*tch, I could go through my greatest hits of insults.

&lt;p&gt;Maher nodded in agreement. For a moment, the two ideological opposites sounded completely in sync. Maher didn’t sugarcoat his assessment of what’s dragging his party down.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Bill Maher Tells Charlie Kirk What&apos;s Really Destroying The Democratic Party

            
Via The Vigilant Fox,
On the latest episode of Club Random, Bill Maher sat down with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk for what many expected to be a clash of political opposites.



But what unfolded was something far more surprising: a candid, wide-ranging conversation that revealed just how much common ground these two actually share—especially when it comes to calling out the modern left.
It kicked off with a sharp joke from Kirk, who warned Maher that the “purple-hair jihadis” would be coming for him next.
“They want to kill me just as bad. Oh, they really do!” Maher responded. He explained, “They hate their own apostates more. I’m supposed to get on the short bus to crazy town with them—and I won’t.”
From there, Maher began to draw a clear line between classic liberal values and what he called the “woke” ideology taking over the Democratic Party.
“I am one of them! They’re not one of me,” he said. “Liberal and woke are two completely different things—woke is very often the opposite.”
Maher explained, “Liberalism is, let’s live in a colorblind society. That’s the goal. Woke’s goal is, ‘We see race everywhere.’ Liberal is, ‘There’s a two-state solution.’ Woke is ‘river to the sea.’”
Then came a line that cut to the core of his frustration: “You got off the F-train, you fell asleep, and you got off at 20 stops too far. Don’t blame me for that.”
What started as a typical podcast on Club Random quickly turned into something way more revealing. @charliekirk11 and Bill Maher weren’t clashing on everything—they were connecting over one uncomfortable truth: the woke cult is tearing the country apart.

The conversation pivoted to an issue even some liberals are struggling to defend: women’s sports. Kirk praised Maher for speaking out.
“You deserve credit for being a liberal that acknowledges male-female distinctions,” he said.
“Oh, of course! Of all the low-lying fruit the Democrats just hand the Republicans to win elections, that’s the one,” Maher responded.
Kirk grinned and asked, “Are they really gonna let us win every national election on this no-men-in-women’s-sports thing?”
Maher answered bluntly: “It’s so ridiculous.”
He cited the stat that 890 trophies had already gone to biological males competing in women’s events—and even pointed out that California’s own Gavin Newsom had backed away from the debate.
“You lost Gavin Newsom on this,” he said. “Take that as a hint.”
The conversation then shifted—this time to an issue even many liberals have started to question——sports.

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s starting to smell like a real trade war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just days after the WSJ reported that Scott Bessent&apos;s grand trade war strategy was to force more than 70 US trade partners to sign bilateral deals while aligning against China, &lt;strong&gt;Beijing has warned it will retaliate against countries that negotiate trade deals with the US “at the expense of China’s interests”, &lt;/strong&gt;fueling global tensions as the world’s two economic superpowers lunge at each other over tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests,” the ministry said on Monday. &lt;strong&gt;“If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“China respects the right of all parties to resolve their economic and trade differences with the United States through equal consultations,” the commerce ministry said adding that if countries encroached on Beijing’s interests, it was “determined and capable of safeguarding its own rights”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ministry added that “all parties should stand on the side of fairness and justice and should defend international economic and trade rules and the multilateral trading system”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It said:&lt;strong&gt; “Once international trade returns to the ‘law of the jungle’, where the strong prey on the weak, all countries will become victims.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_3277f51446f143eda489a1bd5de6f72f.html&quot;&gt;statement by China&apos;s commerce ministry,&lt;/a&gt; which was in response to reports that Trump’s administration planned to use trade talks with multiple countries to try to isolate China, called &lt;strong&gt;on them to instead join Beijing to “resist unilateral bullying.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sharp escalation follows the failure to gain any traction in trade and tariff negotiations. Trump has called several times for Beijing to open negotiations to avert a trade war, and China has said it is open to talks, but neither side has signalled that high-level contacts are under way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While last week&apos;s WSJ report said the US strategy to gang up on China was intended to pressure Beijing to come to the negotiating table and abandon its defiant stance, China has shown little sign of backing down. Instead, president Xi Jinping visited Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia last week, where he sought to shore up relations with Beijing’s trading partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South-east Asian exporters face steep tariffs under the Trump administration, which has also accused them of serving as a transshipment conduit for Chinese goods. Unfortunately for them, without the US as a final customer for most of their exports (including Chinese transshipments), and vows of solidarity will be hollow once countless Pacific rim factories go dark &lt;strong&gt;sparking an economic and labor crisis in countries which have virtually no social safety net.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while China has ironically sought to portray itself as a pillar of the international trading system, it is struggling with weak domestic demand following a deep property slowdown, forcing policymakers to lean on manufacturing and exports for economic growth and leaving the economy vulnerable to the trade war with the US. As a reminder, some 40% of Chinese economic growth is in the form of trade, and while the hit to the US would be mostly along the inflationary and capital market pathways, once more than a third of China&apos;s economy is forced to find new end markets,  the pain for the domestic economic will be orders of magnitude worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s also why Goldman now expects &lt;strong&gt;China&apos;s Q2 real GDP growth to collapse to 0.8% qoq ann from 4.9% in Q1. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Beijing has repeatedly promised various initiatives to spur consumption but has held back from launching a “bazooka” fiscal stimulus (something it can&apos;t do since it has hit debt saturation), instead investing heavily in industry to shake off its reliance on western technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>&quot;That&apos;s Creepy AF&quot;: Whose Hand Is This? </title>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;&quot;That&apos;s Creepy AF&quot;: Whose Hand Is This? &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why has public confidence in the Democratic Party collapsed to record lows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the party that champions illegal alien terrorists and cultural Marxism lost its authenticity a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voters see right through the bullshit of lies, non-sense identity politics, performative accents, and teleprompter-scripted speeches. The American people became outraged last week after Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/political/socialist-aoc-bernie-sanders-caught-using-private-jets-while-fighting-oligarchy-tour&quot;&gt;caught flying around on private jets&lt;/a&gt; while &quot;fighting oligarchy.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the rudderless party is being thrown into a civil war, caught between old-school moderates and far-left activists like David Hogg, Jasmine Crockett, Hakeem Jeffries, and AoC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest Gallup polling data was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/political/confidence-democratic-leadership-sinks-record-low-party-implodes&quot;&gt;nothing more than disastrous&lt;/a&gt; for the party of wokeism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Democratic leadership&apos;s latest 25% confidence rating is an all-time low for the group — well below the previous 34% low recorded in 2023 and the average of 45% since 2001,&quot; Gallup wrote in a report, adding, &quot;Confidence ratings were last at the majority level in 2009 for Democratic congressional leaders and in 2003 for Republican congressional leaders.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_08-48-10.png?itok=3IC8wsOP&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_08-48-10.png?itok=3IC8wsOP&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;f4d03eee-06d6-437f-bd2d-6882c9bb821b&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-20_08-48-10.png?itok=3IC8wsOP&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all of this—and returning to the theme of authenticity—it&apos;s no surprise that a majority of Americans have gravitated toward the &apos;America First&apos; movement. President Trump doesn&apos;t need a teleprompter; he speaks his mind directly and genuinely, which resonates with people who just want peace and prosperity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/political/tesla-takedown-organizers-plan-color-revolution-kill-brand-death-spiral-investors&quot;&gt;not domestic terrorism and protests&lt;/a&gt; that Democrats seem to have embraced in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the theme of authenticity in mind, internet sleuths point out that the Biden team may have photoshopped the former president into a family Easter photo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>&quot;That&apos;s Creepy AF&quot;: Whose Hand Is This? 

            
Why has public confidence in the Democratic Party collapsed to record lows?
In short, the party that champions illegal alien terrorists and cultural Marxism lost its authenticity a long time ago.
Voters see right through the bullshit of lies, non-sense identity politics, performative accents, and teleprompter-scripted speeches. The American people became outraged last week after Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders were caught flying around on private jets while &quot;fighting oligarchy.&quot; 
Meanwhile, the rudderless party is being thrown into a civil war, caught between old-school moderates and far-left activists like David Hogg, Jasmine Crockett, Hakeem Jeffries, and AoC. 
The latest Gallup polling data was nothing more than disastrous for the party of wokeism:
&quot;Democratic leadership&apos;s latest 25% confidence rating is an all-time low for the group — well below the previous 34% low recorded in 2023 and the average of 45% since 2001,&quot; Gallup wrote in a report, adding, &quot;Confidence ratings were last at the majority level in 2009 for Democratic congressional leaders and in 2003 for Republican congressional leaders.&quot; 



Given all of this—and returning to the theme of authenticity—it&apos;s no surprise that a majority of Americans have gravitated toward the &apos;America First&apos; movement. President Trump doesn&apos;t need a teleprompter; he speaks his mind directly and genuinely, which resonates with people who just want peace and prosperity, not domestic terrorism and protests that Democrats seem to have embraced in recent weeks. 
With the theme of authenticity in mind, internet sleuths point out that the Biden team may have photoshopped the former president into a family Easter photo.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;The Death Cross And Market Bottoms&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/the-death-cross-and-market-bottoms/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In financial markets, few technical patterns generate as much attention and anxiety as &lt;strong&gt;the death cross&lt;/strong&gt;. This ominous-sounding term refers to a crossover on a price chart when a short-term moving average, most commonly the 50-day moving average (50-DMA), drops below a long-term moving average, usually the 200-day moving average (200-DMA). The &lt;em&gt;“death cross”&lt;/em&gt; is a fantastic headline for the media to generate clicks and views. However, for investors, the &lt;em&gt;“death cross”&lt;/em&gt; signals a market correction and suggests a more cautious investing approach. But there are a few questions we must answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What does the death cross mean?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How reliable is it as an indicator?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And how should investors respond when they see it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s answer those questions by exploring the death cross’s history, data, and interpretations, and explaining why context matters more than the signal itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Trader-Bear-Market-Liquidity-e17.jpg?itok=E50imApu&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Trader-Bear-Market-Liquidity-e17.jpg?itok=E50imApu&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;4e57f7b4-800e-47df-9af2-b43d01654b06&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Trader-Bear-Market-Liquidity-e17.jpg?itok=E50imApu&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is the Death Cross?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Investopedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The “death cross” market chart pattern refers to the drop of a short-term moving average—meaning the average of recent closing prices for a stock, stock index, commodity, or cryptocurrency over a set period of time—below a longer-term moving average. The most closely watched stock-market moving averages are the 50-day and the 200-day.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For investors, it is essential to note that the death cross is a lagging indicator. It only tells you that price action has deteriorated during the previous two months. In other words, it often only confirms an already obvious trend because it relies on historical data from moving averages. Furthermore, when the death cross occurs, markets are often near a short-term low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss to state that there are periods where the death cross preceded more severe bear markets of the past century, including 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008. However, that is an example of sample selection bias, expressed by using only the selected data points to prove the predictive power of the death cross. Unfortunately, selecting only those data points ignores the numerous occasions when the death cross signaled nothing worse than a market correction and provided significant buying opportunities for investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the following table from Marketwatch shows that since 1950, markets tend to rise within the next 12 months following a death cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-151.jpg?itok=FjHPteKq&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-151.jpg?itok=FjHPteKq&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;f5ee85f4-5659-48da-b5bc-d337a641fadc&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-151.jpg?itok=FjHPteKq&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because, as noted, the markets tend to be very oversold by the time the death cross triggers, and previous optimistic sentiment has reversed. We noted this in this past weekend’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/is-risk-off-positioning-signaling-a-market-low/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;#BullBearReport.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For example, net bullish sentiment among retail and institutional investors is at some of the lowest levels on record, including during the “Financial Crisis.” The extreme negativity is interesting because the recent decline was orderly and mild compared to the chaos during the financial crisis. Yet, investors are as bearish on the current market as they were then. However, it is worth noting that during previous instances when sentiment was as negative as it is currently, such readings were near market bottoms.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-143%20%281%29.jpg?itok=oeGy281-&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-143%20%281%29.jpg?itok=oeGy281-&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;cec02408-7ea5-4f80-bcee-c1373fb7f26a&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-143%20%281%29.jpg?itok=oeGy281-&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Furthermore, the sharp spike in the volatility index, which is considered a “market fear gauge,” spiked to the highest levels seen since the COVID pandemic. If we combine the sentiment measures with the volatility index, we again see more extreme negative readings that often coincide with market lows rather than the beginning of larger reversions.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-144%20%281%29.jpg?itok=bHwCE9h9&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-144%20%281%29.jpg?itok=bHwCE9h9&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;f161f12d-8d6a-4a30-b3f8-6f02abd7e304&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-144%20%281%29.jpg?itok=bHwCE9h9&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, historically speaking, the death cross, more often than not, is a potential contrarian indicator. However, as noted above, there have been instances where the death cross led to much more severe declines. How can investors differentiate between the two?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-structural-bear-markets-versus-event-driven-corrections&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Bear Markets Versus Event-Driven&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Corrections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the media often dramatizes the appearance of a death cross, seasoned investors know it is just one piece of the puzzle. Corrections are part of a normal and healthy market process. As discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/bullish-years-often-have-corrections/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Bullish Years Have Corrections Too:”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In bullish years, markets often have corrections. Yet, after a lengthy bullish run, it always surprises me how quickly investors and the media panic with the slightest hint of a market pullback. During bullish years, corrections happen more often than you think. However, when corrections occur, it is not uncommon to see concerns about a “bear market” rise. However, historically speaking, the stock market increases about 73% of the time. The other 27% of the time, market corrections reverse the excesses of the previous advance. The table below shows the dispersion of returns over time. Critically, note that drawdowns of greater than 10% only occur 13% of the time.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-75-4_0.jpg?itok=qv9UfaiQ&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-75-4_0.jpg?itok=qv9UfaiQ&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;5c7114dd-aef4-4445-bed4-01f02b168b73&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;283&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-75-4_0.jpg?itok=qv9UfaiQ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The correction from this year’s market peak is currently in a range that has only occurred 7% of the time historically, with the market declining 19.4% from peak to trough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far this year, the market decline certainly ranks among some of the worst-performing years in history. However, we are only one-third of the way into 2025, so how this year ends is still widely unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Annual-vs-Intra-Year-Returns-202.jpg?itok=YOiy2Q4m&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Annual-vs-Intra-Year-Returns-202.jpg?itok=YOiy2Q4m&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;dc7a0a09-03de-469d-a55c-047705037d63&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Annual-vs-Intra-Year-Returns-202.jpg?itok=YOiy2Q4m&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is worth noting that since 1980, only eight (8) years have ended with more significant declines. Could this be the ninth? Yes, but for that to occur, we must put previous market declines and larger bear markets into context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between whether the death cross is a shorter-term corrective process or a larger &lt;em&gt;“bear market” decline &lt;/em&gt;depends mainly on whether the cause of the market decline is &lt;em&gt;“event-driven”&lt;/em&gt; or “&lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt;.” As noted recently by the Daily Shot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Structural bear markets have historically been the deepest and longest, averaging over 55% declines and lasting nearly four years. In contrast, event-driven bears tend to be shorter and shallower, with quicker recoveries—averaging around 30% declines and under 10 months in duration. Post-WWII averages (orange diamonds) suggest more moderate outcomes relative to the broader historical record.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-154.jpg?itok=duXwFsGk&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-154.jpg?itok=duXwFsGk&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;638c8b32-6c6c-4200-bebc-f389fb783729&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-154.jpg?itok=duXwFsGk&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This context is important when examining the current decline and triggering of the &lt;em&gt;“death cross.”&lt;/em&gt; The chart below shows the difference in the length of &lt;em&gt;“event-driven”&lt;/em&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;“structural”&lt;/em&gt; corrections, signified by the triggering of the&lt;em&gt; “death cross.”&lt;/em&gt; The dot.com and financial crisis periods were structural events, as significant corporate failures and credit-market dislocations occurred amid deep economic contractions. However, outside of those two significant structural impacts, all other &lt;em&gt;“events” &lt;/em&gt;were short-lived, and markets soon recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/50-200-DMA-Death-Cross-and-Event.jpg?itok=wu5ZNgj0&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/50-200-DMA-Death-Cross-and-Event.jpg?itok=wu5ZNgj0&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;751d7649-599c-49e2-8ee9-0a087c6207e1&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/50-200-DMA-Death-Cross-and-Event.jpg?itok=wu5ZNgj0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the current market correction is driven by concerns over &lt;em&gt;“tariffs,”&lt;/em&gt; it will likely be short-lived. There are two reasons for this view. First, the announced tariffs, which were more onerous than expected, will likely be largely reduced or removed through negotiations. Second, once the tariffs are finalized, the markets will adjust expectations for earnings and focus on future growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question for investors is how to navigate the current market turmoil until this event-driven correction completes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-navigating-the-uncertainty&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigating The Uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean you should ignore the &lt;em&gt;“death cross”&lt;/em&gt; entirely? No. While the current correction is &lt;em&gt;“event-driven”&lt;/em&gt; and will likely resolve itself soon, there is always a risk that something could trigger a &lt;em&gt;“structural”&lt;/em&gt; decline, such as a recession or credit-related event. &lt;strong&gt;While such a risk remains quite low currently, that risk is not zero.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the death cross should not be viewed in isolation or trigger panic-driven decisions. Instead, investors should use it as a cue to take a more thoughtful approach to their portfolio management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅ Stay the Course if Fundamentals Are Sound&lt;/strong&gt;. If your portfolio is well-diversified and aligned with long-term goals, the death cross may just be &lt;strong&gt;noise&lt;/strong&gt; within a broader market cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🌐 Use It as a Risk Management Cue&lt;/strong&gt;. As we noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/the-market-crash-a-set-up-for-a-rally/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Market Crash: Hope In The Fear,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we used the recent rally in the market to reduce risk, hedge portfolios, raise cash, and rebalance allocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📊 Combine with Other Indicators&lt;/strong&gt;. As noted above, while ominous, the current death cross collides with deeply oversold technical readings, as shown below, which typically suggest markets are near short-term lows rather than starting more significant declines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://sentimentrader.com/&quot;&gt;Sentimentrader&lt;/a&gt; tracks 21 indicators in total, which are then combined into a single indicator, giving readings of when markets are trading at more extreme bullish or bearish levels. As shown, the market is currently trading at more extreme risk-off levels. While this does not mean the market is about to rise, historically, such extreme readings have been close to market bottoms.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-125%20%281%29.jpg?itok=IYlVEAEG&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-125%20%281%29.jpg?itok=IYlVEAEG&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;2fb7ee10-dee9-46ce-8861-ff2b34f0d97e&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;289&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-125%20%281%29.jpg?itok=IYlVEAEG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚡ Consider Rebalancing or Rotating&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether the current period is &lt;em&gt;“event-driven”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“structural&lt;/em&gt;,” the market will have intermittent rallies which investors should use to rebalance risk, reallocate holdings, and increase cash levels to reduce volatility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💡 Don’t Ignore the Golden Cross&lt;/strong&gt;. While it is easy to become overly defensive during a corrective period, it is important to remember that eventually the “death cross” will reverse the crossover. When the 50-DMA rises above the 200-DMA, it creates the golden cross, which follows the market bottom. That signals a reversal of the previous process of reducing risk to increasing risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;h-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The death cross is a useful indicator, not a prophecy. It reflects short-term weakness, but doesn’t dictate the future. The key is to treat it as a &lt;strong&gt;signal to pay closer attention&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to the bigger picture, not a call to sell everything and flee to cash.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term investors should remain focused on &lt;strong&gt;fundamentals, diversification, and goals&lt;/strong&gt;. Short-term traders can use it as one of many tools to refine timing. Either way, understanding the death cross puts you in a better position to act with insight rather than emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>The Death Cross And Market Bottoms

            
Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,
In financial markets, few technical patterns generate as much attention and anxiety as the death cross. This ominous-sounding term refers to a crossover on a price chart when a short-term moving average, most commonly the 50-day moving average (50-DMA), drops below a long-term moving average, usually the 200-day moving average (200-DMA). The “death cross” is a fantastic headline for the media to generate clicks and views. However, for investors, the “death cross” signals a market correction and suggests a more cautious investing approach. But there are a few questions we must answer.

	
What does the death cross mean?
How reliable is it as an indicator?
And how should investors respond when they see it?
Let’s answer those questions by exploring the death cross’s history, data, and interpretations, and explaining why context matters more than the signal itself.



What Is the Death Cross?
According to Investopedia:
“The “death cross” market chart pattern refers to the drop of a short-term moving average—meaning the average of recent closing prices for a stock, stock index, commodity, or cryptocurrency over a set period of time—below a longer-term moving average. The most closely watched stock-market moving averages are the 50-day and the 200-day.”
For investors, it is essential to note that the death cross is a lagging indicator. It only tells you that price action has deteriorated during the previous two months. In other words, it often only confirms an already obvious trend because it relies on historical data from moving averages. Furthermore, when the death cross occurs, markets are often near a short-term low.
I would be remiss to state that there are periods where the death cross preceded more severe bear markets of the past century, including 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008. However, that is an example of sample selection bias, expressed by using only the selected data points to prove the predictive power of the death cross. Unfortunately, selecting only those data points ignores the numerous occasions when the death cross signaled nothing worse than a market correction and provided significant buying opportunities for investors.
For example, the following table from Marketwatch shows that since 1950, markets tend to rise within the next 12 months following a death cross.



This is because, as noted, the markets tend to be very oversold by the time the death cross triggers, and previous optimistic sentiment has reversed. We noted this in this past weekend’s #BullBearReport.
“For example, net bullish sentiment among retail and institutional investors is at some of the lowest levels on record, including during the “Financial Crisis.” The extreme negativity is interesting because the recent decline was orderly and mild compared to the chaos during the financial crisis. Yet, investors are as bearish on the current market as they were then. However, it is worth noting that during previous instances when sentiment was as negative as it is currently, such readings were near market bottoms.”



“Furthermore, the sharp spike in the volatility index, which is considered a “market fear gauge,” spiked to the highest levels seen since the COVID pandemic. If we combine the sentiment measures with the volatility index, we again see more extreme negative readings that often coincide with market lows rather than the beginning of larger reversions.”



In other words, historically speaking, the death cross, more often than not, is a potential contrarian indicator. However, as noted above, there have been instances where the death cross led to much more severe declines. How can investors differentiate between the two?
Structural Bear Markets Versus Event-Driven Corrections
While the media often dramatizes the appearance of a death cross, seasoned investors know it is just one piece of the puzzle. Corrections are part of a normal and healthy market process. As discussed in “Bullish Years Have Corrections Too:”
“In bullish years, markets often have corrections. Yet, after a lengthy bullish run, it always surprises me how quickly investors and the media panic with the slightest hint of a market pullback. During bullish years, corrections happen more often than you think. However, when corrections occur, it is not uncommon to see concerns about a “bear market” rise. However, historically speaking, the stock market increases about 73% of the time. The other 27% of the time, market corrections reverse the excesses of the previous advance. The table below shows the dispersion of returns over time. Critically, note that drawdowns of greater than 10% only occur 13% of the time.”



The correction from this year’s market peak is currently in a range that has only occurred 7% of the time historically, with the market declining 19.4% from peak to trough.



So far this year, the market decline certainly ranks among some of the worst-performing years in history. However, we are only one-third of the way into 2025, so how this year ends is still widely unpredictable.



But it is worth noting that since 1980, only eight (8) years have ended with more significant declines. Could this be the ninth? Yes, but for that to occur, we must put previous market declines and larger bear markets into context.
The difference between whether the death cross is a shorter-term corrective process or a larger “bear market” decline depends mainly on whether the cause of the market decline is “event-driven” or “structural.” As noted recently by the Daily Shot:
“Structural bear markets have historically been the deepest and longest, averaging over 55% declines and lasting nearly four years. In contrast, event-driven bears tend to be shorter and shallower, with quicker recoveries—averaging around 30% declines and under 10 months in duration. Post-WWII averages (orange diamonds) suggest more moderate outcomes relative to the broader historical record.”



This context is important when examining the current decline and triggering of the “death cross.” The chart below shows the difference in the length of “event-driven” versus “structural” corrections, signified by the triggering of the “death cross.” The dot.com and financial crisis periods were structural events, as significant corporate failures and credit-market dislocations occurred amid deep economic contractions. However, outside of those two significant structural impacts, all other “events” were short-lived, and markets soon recovered.



Given that the current market correction is driven by concerns over “tariffs,” it will likely be short-lived. There are two reasons for this view. First, the announced tariffs, which were more onerous than expected, will likely be largely reduced or removed through negotiations. Second, once the tariffs are finalized, the markets will adjust expectations for earnings and focus on future growth.
The question for investors is how to navigate the current market turmoil until this event-driven correction completes.
Navigating The Uncertainty
Does this mean you should ignore the “death cross” entirely? No. While the current correction is “event-driven” and will likely resolve itself soon, there is always a risk that something could trigger a “structural” decline, such as a recession or credit-related event. While such a risk remains quite low currently, that risk is not zero.
Furthermore, the death cross should not be viewed in isolation or trigger panic-driven decisions. Instead, investors should use it as a cue to take a more thoughtful approach to their portfolio management.
✅ Stay the Course if Fundamentals Are Sound. If your portfolio is well-diversified and aligned with long-term goals, the death cross may just be noise within a broader market cycle.
🌐 Use It as a Risk Management Cue. As we noted in “Market Crash: Hope In The Fear,” we used the recent rally in the market to reduce risk, hedge portfolios, raise cash, and rebalance allocations.
📊 Combine with Other Indicators. As noted above, while ominous, the current death cross collides with deeply oversold technical readings, as shown below, which typically suggest markets are near short-term lows rather than starting more significant declines.
“Sentimentrader tracks 21 indicators in total, which are then combined into a single indicator, giving readings of when markets are trading at more extreme bullish or bearish levels. As shown, the market is currently trading at more extreme risk-off levels. While this does not mean the market is about to rise, historically, such extreme readings have been close to market bottoms.”



⚡ Consider Rebalancing or Rotating. Whether the current period is “event-driven” or “structural,” the market will have intermittent rallies which investors should use to rebalance risk, reallocate holdings, and increase cash levels to reduce volatility.
💡 Don’t Ignore the Golden Cross. While it is easy to become overly defensive during a corrective period, it is important to remember that eventually the “death cross” will reverse the crossover. When the 50-DMA rises above the 200-DMA, it creates the golden cross, which follows the market bottom. That signals a reversal of the previous process of reducing risk to increasing risk.
Conclusion
The death cross is a useful indicator, not a prophecy. It reflects short-term weakness, but doesn’t dictate the future. The key is to treat it as a signal to pay closer attention to the bigger picture, not a call to sell everything and flee to cash.
Long-term investors should remain focused on fundamentals, diversification, and goals. Short-term traders can use it as one of many tools to refine timing. Either way, understanding the death cross puts you in a better position to act with insight rather than emotion.
