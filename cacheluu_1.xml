      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;This One Weird Trick Let D.C. Judges Stage A Coup&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.danielgreenfield.org/2025/04/this-one-weird-trick-let-dc-judges.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Daniel Greenfield,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supreme Court’s ruling in J.G.G. v. Donald J. Trump was not an unqualified triumph for the Trump administration’s deportations of foreign gang members, but it was a definite rebuke not just to Judge Boasberg, but to the entire D.C. Circuit Court shadow government.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image_2025-04-20_213237519.jpg?itok=E6AvwzsY&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_2025-04-20_213237519.jpg?itok=E6AvwzsY&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ab7038eb-26c2-4ad7-9d7a-bf1d2259c7af&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_2025-04-20_213237519.jpg?itok=E6AvwzsY&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ACLU filed J.G.G. v. Trump in defense of five Venezuelan inmates in New York and Texas. All of the men claimed that they were not gang members and there was no indication that any of them were being deported, denying them any actual standing for coming before the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Especially before Judge James Boasberg who is thousands of miles away in Washington D.C.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of standing and the case being filed in the wrong venue, Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court, not only blocked the deportation of all gang members back to Venezuela, but ordered that planes currently over international airspace that were carrying gang members turn around and bring them back to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boasberg fumed that the planes were not turned around on his mere word and threatened the Justice Department with repercussions for not recognizing his power over not only the entire country, but also the entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But why was a judge from the D.C. Circuit Court on a case involving inmates in Texas?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that leftist organizations and the judges of the D.C. Circuit Court were using one weird trick to seize power over the entire country (if not always the planet) and transform themselves into a shadow government able to block any Trump administration move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court’s ruling vacating Boasberg’s order stated that, “the detainees are confined in Texas, so venue is improper in the District of Columbia” and directed that the appropriate “venue lies in the district of confinement”. So how did a D.C. judge ever get involved at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s concurrence he noted that the “only question is where that judicial review should occur. That venue question turns on whether these transfer claims belong in habeas corpus proceedings or instead may be brought under the Administrative Procedure Act.” The Supreme Court’s ruling even noted that “initially the detainees sought relief in habeas among other causes of action, but they dismissed their habeas claims” and stated that “their claims fall within the ‘core’ of the writ of habeas corpus and thus must be brought in habeas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kavanaugh then laid out a brief history of detainees, including those terrorists at Gitmo, bringing claims under habeas corpus rather than, strangely, under the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Administrative Procedure Act had been created in response to the rise of a vast unaccountable government bureaucracy under FDR. The APA was supposed to stop the administrative state from turning into exactly the kind of self-governing machine it grew into which FDR had described&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontpagemag.com/judicial-coup/&quot;&gt; as threatening to&lt;/a&gt; “develop a fourth branch of government for which there is no sanction in the Constitution.” It was not meant to block presidents from executing their policies or subject every one of those policies to the review of the D.C. Circuit Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The D.C. Circuit Court however has enabled every leftist ‘resistance’ group to go ‘judge shopping’ and file APA complaints to block anything and everything President Trump does.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the ACLU appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court, wielding the Administrative Procedure Act, to challenge the question of whether President Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act (which predated the APA by 148 years) applied and what could be defined as wartime. The ACLU was asking Boasberg to block President Trump’s use of presidential powers based on an act meant to check bureaucratic overreach. And Judge Boasberg went ahead and tried to seize control of U.S. forces abroad from President Trump in the name of an act meant to regulate agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supreme Court’s response to this unconstitutional abomination was milder than it deserved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gave the ACLU and Boasberg the idea that they could get away with it? The ACLU had previously sued the Trump administration for removing materials falsely describing the existence of a ‘transgender’ society as a violation of the “Administrative Procedure Act” by “removing articles without a reasoned basis” as if that were a matter subject to the APA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another case, ‘Judge’ Ana Reyes, a Uruguayan activist lawyer appointed by Biden as the first gay ‘Latinx’ judge in the D.C. Circuit Court, blocked the removal of mentally ill individuals who hallucinate the idea that they are members of some other sex than their biological one, by claiming that it’ss “soaked in animus and dripping with pretext, Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit” and argued, despite the mountain of evidence, that the Department of Defense had “not provided a legitimate reason for banning all transgender troops” and therefore violated the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reyes had confused the Administrative Procedure Act with her own personal opinion and rather than ruling on the legality of a policy based on actual laws, abused the APA to seize power over the Pentagon to promote her own favored social and sexual worldviews in the APA’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the Supreme Court has begun shooting down some APA abuses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its response to a Biden judge in Massachusetts blocking the Trump administration from ending education grants that violate its ban on DEI, the court noted that Judge Myong Joun and the court “lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA” and that monetary cases involving the government are supposed to go to the Court of Federal Claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The APA has become a favored weapon of choice whether the issue at hand is financial, foreign policy, deporting illegal aliens or even publishing materials about the existence of transgenderism on government websites. During the first term of the administration, leftist groups had taken to boasting of having entire “teams of APA litigators and experts”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And with a 93% loss rate for the Trump administration in APA cases, the judicial coup was a sound strategy. &lt;/strong&gt;All a leftist judge had to do was declare that the Trump administration’s actions were “poorly reasoned” or lacked “sufficient rationale” and would override the president’s orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The APA enabled a massive shift of power from the executive branch to district courts, and to the D.C. Circuit Court which had seized virtually unlimited power from both the president and local courts and judges in the process creating an unelected shadow government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the D.C. judicial shadow government overreached itself. And Boasberg’s attempt to seize presidential powers has created a constitutional moment of crisis that may unwind the coup.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <contentSnippet>This One Weird Trick Let D.C. Judges Stage A Coup

            
Authored by Daniel Greenfield,

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Miami Housing Market Hit By &quot;Breathtaking&quot; Collapse In Demand&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Gerli, CEO and Founder of real estate analytics firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://reventureconsulting.com/&quot;&gt;Reventure Consulting&lt;/a&gt;, has issued another troubling update on &lt;strong&gt;Florida&apos;s housing market&lt;/strong&gt;—this time sounding the alarm about a &lt;strong&gt;collapse in demand&lt;/strong&gt; across the Miami metro area. He described the plunge in sales as &quot;&lt;strong&gt;breathtaking&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last few years, we&apos;ve tracked the &lt;strong&gt;post-Covid surge in inventory hitting Sun Belt states&lt;/strong&gt;, including this note from last summer: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was followed by Gerli&apos;s report in late January: &lt;em&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/my-favorite-housing-market-graph-right-now&quot;&gt;My Favorite Housing Market Graph Right Now&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Gerli has offered more color on the &lt;strong&gt;deteriorating housing market&lt;/strong&gt; in Miami:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The collapse in demand in Miami&apos;s housing market is breathtaking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Sales are down 50% from pandemic peak, and are 30% below the long-term average for March. There&apos;s a narrative building in Florida that somehow Miami won&apos;t be impacted by this housing downturn. And that narrative is likely wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inventory in Miami has surged to 51,000 homes&lt;/strong&gt; - the second highest on record. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In some ways, &lt;strong&gt;it&apos;s surprising prices haven&apos;t dropped by more already due to the demand collapse. And resulting inventory spike.&lt;/strong&gt; but in the end housing downturns can take time to play out. And the whole Miami area is at a big risk if the current trends in the market continue,&quot; Gerli noted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Reventure app, prices across &lt;strong&gt;Miami-Dade County are 20.3% overvalued&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Miami Housing Market Hit By &quot;Breathtaking&quot; Collapse In Demand

            
Nick Gerli, CEO and Founder of real estate analytics firm Reventure Consulting, has issued another troubling update on Florida&apos;s housing market—this time sounding the alarm about a collapse in demand across the Miami metro area. He described the plunge in sales as &quot;breathtaking.&quot;
For the last few years, we&apos;ve tracked the post-Covid surge in inventory hitting Sun Belt states, including this note from last summer: 
Florida Housing Downturn &quot;Keeps Getting More Intense By The Day&quot;
This was followed by Gerli&apos;s report in late January: &quot;My Favorite Housing Market Graph Right Now&quot;... 
&quot;My Favorite Housing Market Graph Right Now&quot; https://t.co/yzvc1WIyKM
January 30, 2025

Now Gerli has offered more color on the deteriorating housing market in Miami:
The collapse in demand in Miami&apos;s housing market is breathtaking. Sales are down 50% from pandemic peak, and are 30% below the long-term average for March. There&apos;s a narrative building in Florida that somehow Miami won&apos;t be impacted by this housing downturn. And that narrative is likely wrong.

Gerli debunked some misconceptions about the downturn, with some individuals saying this is &quot;West Coast only.&quot;
1) What I&apos;m starting to hear here on the ground in Florida is that this is a &quot;west coast only&quot; downturn. And that it&apos;s purely the hurricanes that hit Tampa last year that are causing issues.

But in reality - everywhere in Florida&apos;s housing market is negatively impacted,…
April 19, 2025

Inventory in Miami has surged to 51,000 homes - the second highest on record. 
2) Inventory in the Miami metro is up to 51,000 homes, which is the 2nd highest level on record for March according to Realtor&apos;s inventory data set. pic.twitter.com/JHV6g08dYW

Meanwhile. 
3) Meanwhile, price growth in the 3-county metro is now shifting down.

Values are already dropping in Palm Beach (-2.5%) and Broward (-1.1%) YoY.

While they&apos;re still up slightly in Miami-Dade (+1.8%). pic.twitter.com/aZXcn7AtpP

&quot;In some ways, it&apos;s surprising prices haven&apos;t dropped by more already due to the demand collapse. And resulting inventory spike. but in the end housing downturns can take time to play out. And the whole Miami area is at a big risk if the current trends in the market continue,&quot; Gerli noted. 
According to the Reventure app, prices across Miami-Dade County are 20.3% overvalued. 
5) In particular, prices in Miami-Dade county are 20.3% overvalued compared to the long-run norms, indicating some major downside risk. pic.twitter.com/Gwboa5av7y

He warned: &quot;The more overvalued prices are, the greater the risk of downturns.&quot;
6) The more overvalued prices are, the greater the risk of downturns.

You can see Miami went through an epic downturn in the last crash, when prices actually became 33% undervalued.

This is when a lot of people in Miami real estate made their money. pic.twitter.com/vLeaP6vqB9

Separately, and more broadly, the US housing inventory for new homes has hit its highest level since 2007.

&lt;p&gt;The resignation of Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano comes after HSI agents executed a search warrant at his home on Feb. 28—arresting suspected 23-year-old gang member Cristhian Ortega-Lopez there. Agents also took an undisclosed number of other illegal immigrants into custody, and seized four firearms that he handled illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of Ortega-Lopez’s case are wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to court records, the suspected Tren de Aragua member was arrested while entering the U.S. illegally on Dec. 15, 2023. Due to overcrowded Border Patrol facilities, Ortega-Lopez was released three days later.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, he moved to El Paso, Texas, without informing Homeland Security or any other government agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was in El Paso where Ortega-Lopez met Nancy Cano, the wife of Judge Cano.&lt;/strong&gt; The Canos admitted they hired Ortega-Lopez to install a glass door for them—which is illegal since the Venezuelan was not authorized to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ortega-Lopez was evicted from his apartment last April, after which he moved in with the Canos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The suspected Tren de Aragua member’s relationship with the Canos became cozy, so much so that he was introduced to their daughter, April Cano, who let him use her guns—which, like him working without authorization, is illegal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for the Canos, Ortega-Lopez posted pictures of himself with those firearms on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story became arguably even stranger after the HSI agents executed the Feb. 28 search warrant. On March 13, Nancy Cano wrote to U.S. Judge Damian Martinez, pleading for him to have mercy on Ortega-Lopez. In that letter, Cano seemingly admits that she illegally hired the immigrant—and also hired him out to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Each job he got I was told he did an excellent job. No one was ever disappointed. I started to receive more requests for him to return or referral for more jobs,” she said, also enclosing pictures of Ortega-Lopez with the Cano family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“On five different occasions he went through Border Patrol check points with no problems,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;she added—perhaps disclosing yet more crimes. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I took him in as my own son … Please consider his future and give him a chance.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a court hearing the next day, U.S. Judge Damian Martinez asked Justice Department prosecutor Maria Armijio if she knew Judge Cano. When the prosecutor said she didn’t know Judge Cano, Martinez said he did know him—and trusted him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Martinez found that Ortega-Lopez was not a flight risk, and ordered him to be released. The DOJ appealed on March 28, disclosing more information about Ortega-Lopez’s relationship with the Canos, as well as his affiliation with Tren de Aragua. &lt;/strong&gt;According to the DOJ, agents found ample evidence of his gang affiliation while searching his cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agents also allegedly found photographs of two brutal murder victims that includes mutilated bodies, decapitated heads and dismembered hands on Ortega-Lopez’s cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Democrat Judge Caught Harboring Suspected Tren de Aragua Gang Member

            
Authored by Ken Silva via Headline USA,
A county judge in New Mexico has reportedly resigned after Homeland Security Investigations agents arrested a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member and other illegal aliens at his home.



The resignation of Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano comes after HSI agents executed a search warrant at his home on Feb. 28—arresting suspected 23-year-old gang member Cristhian Ortega-Lopez there.

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Salvaror&apos;s President Nayib Bukele has offered to swap 252 Venezuelans deported to his country for &quot;political prisoners&quot; held by Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Combo-Bukele-Maduro-El-Salvador-Venezuela-EFE-.jpg?itok=HQBn4uUt&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Combo-Bukele-Maduro-El-Salvador-Venezuela-EFE-.jpg?itok=HQBn4uUt&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;c0c3622d-9a7a-4f7f-a862-d1891d59b566&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Combo-Bukele-Maduro-El-Salvador-Venezuela-EFE-.jpg?itok=HQBn4uUt&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bukele has agreed to hold deportees from the US in a maximum-security prison known as CECOT in exchange for payment - currently reported at around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-human-rights-law-likely-violated-6m-payment-el-salvador-prison-experts-say&quot;&gt;$6 million&lt;/a&gt; and growing. The Trump administration on March 15 sent 261 suspected illegal alien gang members to CECOT under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and has sent roughly 30 more since then, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration alleges that the deported Venezuelan illegals belong to criminal gangs, including Tren de Aragua, which he deemed a terrorist organization earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Bukele &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/nayibbukele/status/1914070199659098258&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on X that the 252 Venezuelans could be sent to Venezuela in exchange for the same number of &quot;political prisoners&quot; held by the Maduro government under a &quot;humanitarian agreement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Your political prisoners haven’t committed any crime,&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Nicolas Maduro, you have said on numerous occasions that you want the Venezuelans back and free,&quot; reads the post. &quot;Unlike you, who have political prisoners, we don&apos;t have political prisoners. All the Venezuelans we have in custody were detained as part of an operation against gangs like the Tren de Aragua in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unlike our detainees, many of whom have committed murder, others have committed rape, and some have even been arrested multiple times before being deported, &lt;strong&gt;your political prisoners have committed no crime. The only reason they are imprisoned is because they opposed you and your electoral fraud.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that includes &lt;strong&gt;the repatriation of 100% of the 252 Venezuelans&lt;/strong&gt; who were deported, in exchange for the release and delivery of an identical number (252) of the thousands of political prisoners that you hold,&quot; Bukele continued (translated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Maduro accepts the deal, it could ease political pressure on the Trump administration, which has been accused of denying due process to illegals and was temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court on Saturday from further deportations under the 18th century law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal comes after &lt;strong&gt;US Democrats dropped everything to demand the return of a &apos;wrongly deported&apos; El Salvadoran national living in the US illegally, Kilmar Abrego Garcia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>El Salvador Offers To Swap Venezuelans Deported From US For Political Prisoners Held By Venezuela

            
El Salvaror&apos;s President Nayib Bukele has offered to swap 252 Venezuelans deported to his country for &quot;political prisoners&quot; held by Venezuela.



Bukele has agreed to hold deportees from the US in a maximum-security prison known as CECOT in exchange for payment - currently reported at around $6 million and growing. The Trump administration on March 15 sent 261 suspected illegal alien gang members to CECOT under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and has sent roughly 30 more since then, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
The Trump administration alleges that the deported Venezuelan illegals belong to criminal gangs, including Tren de Aragua, which he deemed a terrorist organization earlier this year.
On Sunday, Bukele wrote on X that the 252 Venezuelans could be sent to Venezuela in exchange for the same number of &quot;political prisoners&quot; held by the Maduro government under a &quot;humanitarian agreement.&quot;
&quot;Your political prisoners haven’t committed any crime,&quot; he wrote.
&quot;Mr. Nicolas Maduro, you have said on numerous occasions that you want the Venezuelans back and free,&quot; reads the post. &quot;Unlike you, who have political prisoners, we don&apos;t have political prisoners. All the Venezuelans we have in custody were detained as part of an operation against gangs like the Tren de Aragua in the United States.
&quot;Unlike our detainees, many of whom have committed murder, others have committed rape, and some have even been arrested multiple times before being deported, your political prisoners have committed no crime. The only reason they are imprisoned is because they opposed you and your electoral fraud.
&quot;I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that includes the repatriation of 100% of the 252 Venezuelans who were deported, in exchange for the release and delivery of an identical number (252) of the thousands of political prisoners that you hold,&quot; Bukele continued (translated).
If Maduro accepts the deal, it could ease political pressure on the Trump administration, which has been accused of denying due process to illegals and was temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court on Saturday from further deportations under the 18th century law.
The proposal comes after US Democrats dropped everything to demand the return of a &apos;wrongly deported&apos; El Salvadoran national living in the US illegally, Kilmar Abrego Garcia. 



Garcia, whose wife issued a restraining order for domestic violence, was issued a deportation order and was later given a &quot;withholding of removal&quot; status due to danger he faced from a &apos;rival gang&apos; if he returned to El Salvador.



Last week, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador after Bukele refused to cooperate with an order by the US Supreme Court instructing the Trump administration to &quot;facilitate&quot; the return of Abrego Garcia.
According to Venezuelan rights group Foro Penal, there are 903 political prisoners being held by Maduro, including protesters and opposition leaders.

	&lt;li&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The U.S. Trade Representative states the move aims to address Chinese dominance and bolster the U.S. shipbuilding industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The U.S. move to penalize China-built and China-owned vessels calling at U.S. ports&lt;/strong&gt; could lead to an oil supertanker made in China and operated by a Chinese company facing a fee of up to $5.2 million per call at a U.S. port, shipbrokers have estimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-21_mc5mkco7bo.jpg?itok=WOTSxaX5&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-21_mc5mkco7bo.jpg?itok=WOTSxaX5&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;bcee1692-4d23-4ff2-8414-2b5d3365750c&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;209&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-21_mc5mkco7bo.jpg?itok=WOTSxaX5&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://ustr.gov/about/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2025/april/ustr-section-301-action-chinas-targeting-maritime-logistics-and-shipbuilding-sectors-dominance&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; fees on vessel owners and operators of China based on net tonnage per U.S. voyage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous proposal was a per-port-entry fee of up to $1.5 million on Chinese-built vessels, and up to a $1 million per-port-entry fee on any vessel (Chinese-built or non-Chinese-built) for operators that have any Chinese-built vessels in their fleet or orderbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) plans to impose fees on operators of Chinese-built ships based on net tonnage or containers, increasing incrementally over the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the new USTR move, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said, “Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The Trump administration’s actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the U.S. supply chain, and send a demand signal for U.S.-built ships,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Greer added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the new plan, the fee on a China-made China-operated supertanker could reach up to $5.2 million per call because of the large tonnage of the supertankers compared to smaller oil tankers, according to the research arm of Arrow Shipbroking Group cited by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-21/china-owned-supertankers-face-5-2-million-in-fees-per-us-call?embedded-checkout=true&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The previous per-call only fee would have charged up to $3.5 million for a tanker to call at a U.S. port.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil traders have already started to &lt;a href=&quot;https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Traders-Shun-Chinese-Tankers-as-Trump-Prepares-Port-Fees.html&quot;&gt;avoid hiring tankers&lt;/a&gt; built in China amid concerns that port fees could be coming for Chinese vessels at U.S. ports as part of a plan by President Donald Trump to revitalize the American shipbuilding industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oil traders and charterers that are booking vessels to call, load, or discharge cargoes at U.S. ports are seeking vessels not built in China, &lt;/strong&gt;market sources told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-03/oil-traders-shun-china-made-ships-for-us-flows-on-trump-levies&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

The U.S. is introducing fees on operators of China-built vessels calling at U.S. ports.
These fees could reach up to $5.2 million per call for large supertankers.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;&quot;He Who Has The Gold Makes The Rules&quot; President Trump Proclaims Over Easter Weekend&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many are still wondering about whether or not the audit of Fort Knox is happening, it doesn&apos;t seem like President Trump doubts the country&apos;s gold holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With gold surging through $3420/oz. for the first time ever this morning, many are pointing back to one of President Trump&apos;s Truth Social posts from yesterday. Trump wrote on Easter: &quot;THE GOLDEN RULE OF NEGOTIATING AND SUCCESS: HE WHO HAS THE GOLD MAKES THE RULES. THANK YOU!&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall, in early 2025, Donald Trump and Elon Musk publicly questioned whether Fort Knox still holds its gold reserves. Trump announced plans to visit the site, while Musk suggested a live-streamed inspection, saying, “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20at%209.26.51%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?itok=9KuQfSdy&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20at%209.26.51%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?itok=9KuQfSdy&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;8bf0f10d-ccb0-4984-9240-fc8b4e4480f0&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;187&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20at%209.26.51%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?itok=9KuQfSdy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent then responded by citing a 2024 audit confirming the presence of 147.3 million ounces of gold, with no major withdrawals in years. He added that senators can request a tour through his office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we&apos;ve laid out a number of reasons we think gold is surging in our article out this morning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/market-recaps/us-stock-futures-dollar-treasuries-tumble-powell-punt-panic-gold-bitcoin-soar&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;in a sign that investors are rotating investments away from the US, Deutsche Bank AG said that Chinese clients have reduced some of their Treasuries holdings in favor of European debt. European high-quality bonds, Japanese government bonds and gold are likely to be the potential choices for investors as alternatives to Treasuries, said Lillian Tao, head of China macro and global emerging market sales at the bank,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/market-recaps/us-stock-futures-dollar-treasuries-tumble-powell-punt-panic-gold-bitcoin-soar&quot;&gt;we wrote earlier this morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there was no specific catalyst for the suddenly collapse in the illiquid early Asian session, which saw many countries on extended Easter holiday, Bloomberg quoted traders that hedge funds are selling the dollar against virtually any currencies after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that President Donald Trump is still exploring ways to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The president and his team will continue to study that,” National Economic Council Director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-18/trump-studying-whether-removing-powell-is-option-hassett-says&quot;&gt;Kevin Hassett said Friday&lt;/a&gt; when asked by a reporter if removing Powell was an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hassett then suggested, accurately, that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The policy of this Federal Reserve was to raise rates the minute President Trump was elected last time, to say that the supply-side tax cuts that were going to be inflationary,” Hassett said, adding that Fed officials opted not to go “on TV and at IMF meetings and warn about the terrible inflation from the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden, and the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden was textbook inflationary,” Hassett continued. “And then they cut rates right ahead of the election.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>&quot;He Who Has The Gold Makes The Rules&quot; President Trump Proclaims Over Easter Weekend

            
While many are still wondering about whether or not the audit of Fort Knox is happening, it doesn&apos;t seem like President Trump doubts the country&apos;s gold holdings.
With gold surging through $3420/oz. for the first time ever this morning, many are pointing back to one of President Trump&apos;s Truth Social posts from yesterday. Trump wrote on Easter: &quot;THE GOLDEN RULE OF NEGOTIATING AND SUCCESS: HE WHO HAS THE GOLD MAKES THE RULES. THANK YOU!&quot;. 
Recall, in early 2025, Donald Trump and Elon Musk publicly questioned whether Fort Knox still holds its gold reserves. Trump announced plans to visit the site, while Musk suggested a live-streamed inspection, saying, “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not.”



Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent then responded by citing a 2024 audit confirming the presence of 147.3 million ounces of gold, with no major withdrawals in years. He added that senators can request a tour through his office.
Meanwhile, we&apos;ve laid out a number of reasons we think gold is surging in our article out this morning here. 
&quot;in a sign that investors are rotating investments away from the US, Deutsche Bank AG said that Chinese clients have reduced some of their Treasuries holdings in favor of European debt. European high-quality bonds, Japanese government bonds and gold are likely to be the potential choices for investors as alternatives to Treasuries, said Lillian Tao, head of China macro and global emerging market sales at the bank,&quot; we wrote earlier this morning.



While there was no specific catalyst for the suddenly collapse in the illiquid early Asian session, which saw many countries on extended Easter holiday, Bloomberg quoted traders that hedge funds are selling the dollar against virtually any currencies after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that President Donald Trump is still exploring ways to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to traders.
“The president and his team will continue to study that,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday when asked by a reporter if removing Powell was an option.
Hassett then suggested, accurately, that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats.
“The policy of this Federal Reserve was to raise rates the minute President Trump was elected last time, to say that the supply-side tax cuts that were going to be inflationary,” Hassett said, adding that Fed officials opted not to go “on TV and at IMF meetings and warn about the terrible inflation from the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden, and the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden was textbook inflationary,” Hassett continued. “And then they cut rates right ahead of the election.”

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador, the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is working with the computer chip giant Nvidia to implement artificial intelligence for national development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador signed a letter of intent to collaborate with Nvidia on “sovereign AI to drive innovation and economic growth,” the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) of El Salvador &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/bitcoinofficesv/status/1914288066056904796&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on X on April 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the collaboration, El Salvador will benefit from Nvidia’s AI tools, resources and expertise, enabling the development of sovereign AI capabilities targeting priorities related to culture, language, environment and economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“El Salvador will focus on building domestic AI infrastructure, upskilling the workforce, and creating solutions to address local challenges such as improving healthcare delivery, advancing education, and boosting economic productivity,” the announcement said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AI training for state officials and developers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador’s latest collaboration with Nvidia marks the country’s commitment to encouraging AI usage to optimize multiple processes within the government and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its new AI push, El Salvador intends to establish AI training programs for developers, researchers and government officials to “ensure the nation has the talent to sustain its AI ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador’s Nvidia partnership adds to a growing list of AI-focused initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2025, the ONBTC announced Salvador’s university-level public education AI program CUBO_ai, touting it as the “only national education program bringing in top-tier field experts.” The program was announced with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cointelegraph.com/news/cathie-wood-kick-off-el-salvador-ai-education-program&quot;&gt;support from major Bitcoin bull Cathie Wood&lt;/a&gt;, who is expected to give the first lecture as part of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday the Kremlin acknowledged that &lt;strong&gt;military action has resumed&lt;/strong&gt;, and also emphasized again that the ceasefire which began Saturday evening was indicative of its attitude that it is indeed open to any peace initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Our attitude to ceasefires is positive&lt;/strong&gt;, and that is why we proposed the initiative, especially as it was during the holy Easter days,&quot; Putin had said of the special holiday weekend truce. &quot;We’ve seen the initial reaction [from Kiev], as I believe everyone did. The statement characterized our proposal as ‘playing with lives’ and so on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky had quickly accused Putin of not being genuine, and suggested it was a PR move intended to signal the Trump administration. &quot;As of Easter morning, we can say that the Russian army is trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places, it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine,&quot; he had posted on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are &lt;strong&gt;only interested in favorable PR coverage&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; Zelensky wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Putin had pointed out, &quot;Apparently, smarter people – probably foreign handlers – explained that refusing such a proposal is a losing proposition for the Kiev regime, and [the Ukrainians] swiftly agreed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has also shot back in fresh Monday statements that Zelensky was &lt;strong&gt;&quot;ready to reject Easter ceasefire — until his Western curators reminded him it&apos;s bad PR to oppose peace outright.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has meanwhile &lt;strong&gt;proposed extending the truce for 30 days&lt;/strong&gt; after it ended midnight Sunday, resulting in the Kremlin saying it is studying the possibility. Putin has since said he is &lt;strong&gt;reviewing a Ukrainian proposal for each side to case attacks on any civilian infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Putin has made clear that he&apos;s not interested in a merely temporary solution, but wants to achieve something lasing, on fears that Ukraine would just use a 30-day window to rearm and regroup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russian state media has published footage showing that during the Easter truce there was &lt;strong&gt;some positive, peaceful engagement among some troops on the ground&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

As the for US, the State Department on Sunday that the US remains committed to &quot;a full and comprehensive ceasefire.&quot; The Trump administration has made clear it is losing patience, and that both sides need to move fast toward the negotiating table.
Ukraine&apos;s Air Force confirmed on Monday the resumption of heavy strikes, describing Russian forces launched 96 drones and three missiles on eastern and southern Ukraine overnight.

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/divisions-remain-as-republicans-steam-ahead-with-big-beautiful-bill-what-to-know-5844985?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Jackson Richman, Arjun Singh, and Joseph Lord via The Epoch Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Republicans barrel full steam ahead with President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” several divisions over components of the package linger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2896%29_5.jpg?itok=HR6qv6Ln&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2896%29_5.jpg?itok=HR6qv6Ln&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;3062b4a1-329e-489f-84ea-45af3dfefa24&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2896%29_5.jpg?itok=HR6qv6Ln&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, both chambers approved a budget blueprint that resulted from weeks of negotiations between the House and Senate, unlocking the reconciliation process being used to pass the package. In the coming weeks, the difficult work of passing Trump’s legislative agenda begins in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dubbed the “one, big, beautiful bill” by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), it is expected to consist of measures related to tax cuts, America’s energy sector, and securing the border.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reconciliation bill, it would be immune from the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate—but only if House Republicans can agree on a package first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Republicans’ narrow majority in the lower chamber—&lt;strong&gt;Johnson can spare no more than three defections&lt;/strong&gt;—passing this package will be a herculean task for leadership. Johnson will need to keep both moderates and conservatives happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about the lingering disputes as Republicans move forward with drafting the text of their bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Border Security, Energy, and Defense&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core components of the Republican budget proposal unveiled by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)—bolstering border security, funding energy expansion, and new defense appropriations—are generally non-controversial with broad swaths of Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In line with his chief policy priority during the 2024 presidential election, Trump and Republicans have sought to implement sweeping changes to how immigration and border security are handled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That includes both ongoing efforts to stem the flow of illegal immigrants across the U.S. southern border with Mexico and what Trump has promised will be the “largest deportation operation in American history.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding will target increased deportation-related detentions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Immigration Court hearings, and removal operations. Beyond removals, the Trump administration is pursuing the finalized construction of a border wall between the United States and Mexico, Trump’s main campaign promise in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has told The Epoch Times that he seeks to have his state “reimbursed” for its ongoing border security efforts under “Operation Lone Star” run by Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Texas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“[I want some] reimbursing [of] the State of Texas for the billions they’ve spent dealing with Joe Biden and the Democrats’ failure to secure the border,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Cruz told The Epoch Times on March 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the package will include new funding for energy and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump and his allies have been outspoken about their support of enhancing U.S. drilling, fracking, and natural gas extraction. During the 2024 election, Trump summarized his position as “Drill, baby, drill.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s argued that new and renewable energy sources should be used alongside traditional fossil fuel-based infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While policy changes in a reconciliation bill are restricted under the rules of the process, Republicans are sure to pursue an increase in energy production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current budget blueprint additionally instructs the House and Senate to allocate an additional $100 billion and $150 billion, respectively, toward defense over a decade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aspects of the bill are among the least controversial with Republicans. Some other components will be a tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tax Cuts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centerpiece of the Senate’s budget blueprint, which has since been approved by the House, is its plan to make permanent the personal income tax cuts first authorized by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The GOP proposal comes out to a top-line cost of around $4.5 trillion in lost potential tax revenue for the government.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without congressional action, those cuts will expire at the end of 2025 and rates will increase—a potential political nightmare for Republicans at the ballot box in 2026 if the issue isn’t addressed before Tax Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to implement these new rates permanently, Republicans must comply with the Byrd Rule, a rule governing the reconciliation process, which requires that any policy that impacts the deficit beyond ten years must be sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This could face challenges in both the House and Senate, however. Without steep spending cuts alongside these tax cuts, critics fear that the deficit could balloon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lower chamber, many lawmakers—such as budget hawks like Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), and members of the House Freedom Caucus—have expressed these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the House budget instructions currently call for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts—already a difficult ask—conservatives have indicated they won’t support any package that comes in at less than $2 trillion in cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But such steep cuts could equally alienate the moderate wing of the GOP: members like Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) and fellow purple district Republicans in California and New York have sought assurance that these spending cuts won’t harm key entitlements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threading the needle between these competing impulses will be challenging for leadership.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Medicaid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The budget resolution instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to cut $880 billion in spending over a decade, an amount that critics suspect will result in reductions to Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is Democrats’ main rallying point against the proposal, with several arguing that Republicans are planning to “gut Medicaid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson has said there will be no substantive cuts, but will only target waste, fraud, and abuse in the program. Trump has also expressed clear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/fact-check-president-trump-will-always-protect-social-security-medicare/&quot;&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt; to making any substantive cuts to the entitlement program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There are a lot of Americans who rely upon those—those programs, and we’ve got to ensure that they’re safeguarded,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; said Johnson on Fox News on April 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Johnson argued that there’s abuse in the program that can be rooted out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you have people on the program that are draining the resources, it takes it away from the people that are actually needing it the most and are intended to receive it. You’re talking about young single mothers down on their fortunes at the moment, the people with the real disabilities, the elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least 12 Republicans have come out against Medicaid cuts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Balancing the federal budget must not come at the expense of those who depend on these benefits for their health and economic security,” they wrote in an April 14 letter to Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Debt Ceiling Increase&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The budget resolution also calls for the House to increase the nation’s borrowing limit by $4 trillion and the Senate by $5 trillion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senate figure has come under fire by conservatives in the House such as members of the Freedom Caucus. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) initially told The Epoch Times that the budget resolution was “DEAD ON ARRIVAL” in the House, though he eventually voted for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debt ceiling is set to be reached within the next few months, though the exact timing is uncertain. Were the limit to not be lifted, the United States could go into default for the fifth time in its history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The debt limit has usually been increased on a bipartisan basis as it last was in 2023. However, by raising it without Democrat support, the GOP is looking to do so by pairing it with significant fiscal measures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the issue could still divide the two chambers, as the Senate seeks a greater debt limit bump than many House conservatives can stomach in the final package.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Divisions Remain As Republicans Steam Ahead With &apos;Big Beautiful Bill&apos;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/bfm36F1.jpg?itok=q-kJ7DC-&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/bfm36F1.jpg?itok=q-kJ7DC-&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;3051200d-3fbc-41e2-ba8f-d9ca9f43bebc&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/bfm36F1.jpg?itok=q-kJ7DC-&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumer Sentiment and Stock Prices were the biggest negative contributors&lt;/strong&gt;, while Building Permits and Jobless Claims were the biggest positive contributors...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/bfmCC63.jpg?itok=e9tMD3Gt&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/bfmCC63.jpg?itok=e9tMD3Gt&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;33390d9b-c888-424d-9fab-6a237c9d0ed6&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;121&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/bfmCC63.jpg?itok=e9tMD3Gt&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That dragged the total index level down to its lowest since October 2016...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/bfmC297.jpg?itok=DBjNlHaw&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/bfmC297.jpg?itok=DBjNlHaw&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;8f814764-42e7-40d6-b94c-79a99e40b2e4&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;284&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/bfmC297.jpg?itok=DBjNlHaw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The US LEI for March pointed to slowing economic activity ahead,” said Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, Senior Manager, Business Cycle Indicators, at The Conference Board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;That said, the data does not suggest that a recession has begun or is about to start.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still, the Conference Board downwardly revised our US GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 1.6%, which is somewhat below the economy’s potential. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The slower projected growth rate reflects the impact of deepening trade wars, which may result in higher inflation, supply chain disruptions, less investing and spending, and a weaker labor market.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LEI’s six-month growth rate ticked down in March, but &lt;strong&gt;remained well above the recession threshold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-21_07-10-53.jpg?itok=AX-lrN7y&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-21_07-10-53.jpg?itok=AX-lrN7y&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;7e36d8bc-5dfa-4298-8c53-86d94f8b8360&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-21_07-10-53.jpg?itok=AX-lrN7y&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the economy is doomed (ish) because stocks and sentiment are down... because investors are pricing in a doomed economy...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perhaps the word &apos;leading&apos; in this index is misleading...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Since December&apos;s Trump-optimism-driven surge in Leading Economic Indicators (the first since last February), The Conference Board&apos;s headline index has decelerated rapidly with March data released today plunging 0.7% MoM - the biggest drop since October 2023...



Consumer Sentiment and Stock Prices were the biggest negative contributors, while Building Permits and Jobless Claims were the biggest positive contributors...



That dragged the total index level down to its lowest since October 2016...



“The US LEI for March pointed to slowing economic activity ahead,” said Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, Senior Manager, Business Cycle Indicators, at The Conference Board.
&quot;That said, the data does not suggest that a recession has begun or is about to start. 
Still, the Conference Board downwardly revised our US GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 1.6%, which is somewhat below the economy’s potential. 
The slower projected growth rate reflects the impact of deepening trade wars, which may result in higher inflation, supply chain disruptions, less investing and spending, and a weaker labor market.&quot;
The LEI’s six-month growth rate ticked down in March, but remained well above the recession threshold



So the economy is doomed (ish) because stocks and sentiment are down... because investors are pricing in a doomed economy...?
Perhaps the word &apos;leading&apos; in this index is misleading...

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Dearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis. At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favor of the poorest and most marginalized. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vatican News provided more color on the Pope&apos;s deteriorating health leading up to his death on Easter Monday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pope was admitted to the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital on Friday, February 14, 2025, after suffering from a bout of bronchitis for several days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pope Francis&apos; clinical situation gradually worsened, and his doctors diagnosed bilateral pneumonia on Tuesday, February 18.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After 38 days in hospital, the late Pope returned to his Vatican residence at the Casa Santa Marta to continue his recovery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To his 1.3 billion followers, Francis signaled a more inclusive stance toward LGBTQ+ Catholics and advocated for open borders in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout his tenure (March 13, 2013 to April 21, 2025), Francis also spoke about multiple recurring themes, including compassion, humility, and advocacy. He told followers, &quot;My people are poor, and I am one of them.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance met with Francis to exchange Easter greetings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know you have not been feeling great, but it&apos;s good to see you in better health,&quot; Vance told the Pope, adding, &quot;Thank you for seeing me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Vatican News reports that Pope Francis died at the age of 88 at 7:35 a.m. local time (1:35 a.m. EST). Earlier this year, he experienced a severe health crisis that resulted in over a month of hospitalization due to double pneumonia.



Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, announced the death of the 266th pope via this statement:
&quot;Dearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis. At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father.

When both sides of our mandate start getting worse at the same time, there’s not a generic playbook that you turn to.” He also added, “How we respond to a stagflationary shock depends on which one’s worse, how long are they going to last, are higher prices transitory or permanent, on the growth side, is this a response to uncertainty or is this spiraling more into recession.”&lt;/li&gt;

Q&amp;A is expected. On March 26, Kashkari said, “It’s conceivable that the hit to confidence could be a bigger effect than the tariffs themselves, and that makes me nervous, but the good news is the hit to confidence could be restored quickly if there are resolutions of these trade uncertainties.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;02:30 PM Richmond Fed President Barkin (FOMC non-voter) speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will participate in a fireside chat at the RVA Big Dipper Innovation Summit in Richmond, Virginia. Q&amp;A is expected. On April 1, Barkin said, “So far, the tariffs that have been announced have been revised. I plan to give it some time to see if we can figure out what a stable policy regime is [for tariffs] and then we can start thinking more about monetary policy.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;04:00 PM Fed Governor Kugler speaks:&lt;/strong&gt; Fed Governor Adriana Kugler will speak on the transmission of monetary policy at the University of Minnesota School of Public Affairs. Q&amp;A is expected. On April 2, Kugler said, “Given the recent lack of progress on inflation, recent increases in inflation expectations, and upside risks associated with announced and prospective policy changes… I will support maintaining the current policy rate for as long as these upside risks to inflation continue, while economic activity and employment remain stable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, April 23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fed Governor Kugler speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Fed Governor Adriana Kugler will attend and give brief introductory remarks at a Mille Lacs tribal meeting. The exact meeting time is TBD.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09:35 AM Fed Governor Waller speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Fed Governor Christopher Waller will give opening remarks at a Fed Listens event. On April 14, Waller said, “With large tariff increases, I would expect the U.S. economy to slow significantly later this year and this slower pace to continue into next year.” He also added, “If the slowdown is significant and even threatens a recession, then I would expect to favor cutting the FOMC&apos;s policy rate sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.”&lt;/li&gt;

Speech text and Q&amp;A are expected. On April 16, Hammack said, “Given the economy’s starting point, and with both sides of our mandate expected to be under pressure, there is a strong case to hold monetary policy steady in order to balance the risks coming from further elevated inflation and a slowing labor market.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, April 24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There are no major economic data releases scheduled.
08:30 AM Chicago Fed President Goolsbee (FOMC voter) speaks:  Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee is scheduled to appear on CNBC. On April 11, Goolsbee said, “It makes the Fed’s job harder if you get what is clearly a stagflationary shock. When both sides of our mandate start getting worse at the same time, there’s not a generic playbook that you turn to.” He also added, “How we respond to a stagflationary shock depends on which one’s worse, how long are they going to last, are higher prices transitory or permanent, on the growth side, is this a response to uncertainty or is this spiraling more into recession.”
Tuesday, April 22
There are no major economic data releases scheduled.
09:00 AM Fed Vice Chair Jefferson speaks: Fed Vice Chair Phillip Jefferson will give a speech on economic mobility and the dual mandate at the Economic Mobility Summit hosted by the Philadelphia Fed. Speech text is expected. On April 3, Jefferson said, “Labor market conditions have remained stable through February, and progress on inflation has eased, but the outlook is uncertain.” He also added, “These conditions led me to favor holding the policy rate constant at what I view as a moderately restrictive level.”

01:30 PM Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari (FOMC non-voter) speaks: Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari will participate in a moderated discussion at the US Chamber of Commerce Global Summit in Washington DC. Q&amp;A is expected. On March 26, Kashkari said, “It’s conceivable that the hit to confidence could be a bigger effect than the tariffs themselves, and that makes me nervous, but the good news is the hit to confidence could be restored quickly if there are resolutions of these trade uncertainties.”
02:30 PM Richmond Fed President Barkin (FOMC non-voter) speaks: Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will participate in a fireside chat at the RVA Big Dipper Innovation Summit in Richmond, Virginia. Q&amp;A is expected. On April 1, Barkin said, “So far, the tariffs that have been announced have been revised. I plan to give it some time to see if we can figure out what a stable policy regime is [for tariffs] and then we can start thinking more about monetary policy.”
04:00 PM Fed Governor Kugler speaks: Fed Governor Adriana Kugler will speak on the transmission of monetary policy at the University of Minnesota School of Public Affairs. Q&amp;A is expected. On April 2, Kugler said, “Given the recent lack of progress on inflation, recent increases in inflation expectations, and upside risks associated with announced and prospective policy changes… I will support maintaining the current policy rate for as long as these upside risks to inflation continue, while economic activity and employment remain stable.”
Wednesday, April 23
Fed Governor Kugler speaks: Fed Governor Adriana Kugler will attend and give brief introductory remarks at a Mille Lacs tribal meeting. The exact meeting time is TBD.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Wedbush&apos;s Dan Ives Warns About &quot;Code Red&quot; Situation Unfolding At Tesla &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just weeks after Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives slashed his Tesla price target by 43%, citing a brand crisis fueled by CEO Elon Musk&apos;s involvement with DOGE, he&apos;s back with another warning about a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;code red&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; moment for the most American-made car brand—one day before its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; Ives penned in a note to clients on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla....and anyone that thinks the brand damage Musk has inflicted is not a real thing, spend some time speaking to car buyers in the US, Europe, and Asia. You will think differently after those discussions&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Ives, whose analyst rating on the stock remains &quot;Buy&quot; rated, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/wedbushs-daniel-ives-cuts-tesla-price-target-says-brand-has-morphed-political-symbol&quot;&gt;slashed his price target&lt;/a&gt; to $315, down from $550. He explained, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally, adding, &quot;It is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the analyst, Tesla faces &quot;&lt;strong&gt;potentially 15%-20% permanent demand destruction for future Tesla buyers due to the brand damage Musk has created with DOGE. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Yet we must point out that the Tesla protests were small-scale and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/political/tesla-takedown-organizers-plan-color-revolution-kill-brand-death-spiral-investors&quot;&gt;funded by corrupt NGOs&lt;/a&gt; connected with rogue billionaires and the Democratic Party. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news for Ives is that Musk is a special government employee with DOGE, a temporary federal employee who can only work 130 days a year. There are ways around extending SGE time, but a recent report from Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said Musk is expected to step back from his hole once the 130 days lapse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ives remained bullish on Tesla, calling the brand one of the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;most disruptive technology companies on the globe over the coming years&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; Yet he said Tesla needs its &quot;most important asset&quot;: Musk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Tesla will announce its earnings for the first quarter. From a delivery perspective, we already have a good idea about weak sales—that&apos;s because it releases delivery numbers for the quarter several weeks before it releases its full results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of April, Tesla &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/tesla-deliveries-tktktktk-draft-do-not-publish&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 330,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, missing Goldman, JPM, Morgan Stanley, and UBS&apos; estimates of between 351,000 and 375,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla shares have been halved since their record high on Dec. 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of the latest Wall Street consensus (data via Bloomberg), 54.1% of analysts covering Tesla maintain a &quot;Buy&quot; rating, 24.6% rate the stock as &quot;Hold,&quot; and 21.3% assign a &quot;Sell&quot; rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Snag_1a2fc9dc.png?itok=gYv_TK-k&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Snag_1a2fc9dc.png?itok=gYv_TK-k&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;f7c438b0-8655-4208-8fc2-e922700b33d4&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;402&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Snag_1a2fc9dc.png?itok=gYv_TK-k&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ives concluded, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;We view this as a fork in the road time: if Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage, but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; adding, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;If Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House, it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow.&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Wedbush&apos;s Dan Ives Warns About &quot;Code Red&quot; Situation Unfolding At Tesla 

            
Just weeks after Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives slashed his Tesla price target by 43%, citing a brand crisis fueled by CEO Elon Musk&apos;s involvement with DOGE, he&apos;s back with another warning about a &quot;code red&quot; moment for the most American-made car brand—one day before its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday.

Tesla shares have been halved since their record high on Dec. 17.



As of the latest Wall Street consensus (data via Bloomberg), 54.1% of analysts covering Tesla maintain a &quot;Buy&quot; rating, 24.6% rate the stock as &quot;Hold,&quot; and 21.3% assign a &quot;Sell&quot; rating.



Ives concluded, &quot;We view this as a fork in the road time: if Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage, but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO,&quot; adding, &quot;If Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House, it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow.&quot;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Klaus Schwab Steps Down From WEF Board Amid Globalist Retreat&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same day Pope Francis—known for his inclusive beliefs—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/pope-francis-dies-88&quot;&gt;passed away&lt;/a&gt;, another globalist fell: Klaus Schwab, the architect of the World Economic Forum&apos;s dystopian agenda, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/press/2025/04/world-economic-forum-announces-governance-transition/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; he was stepping down from the WEF board. It marks the end of an era for Schwab, who championed radical wokeness, bug eating, mass vaccination campaigns, population control, and climate de-growth policies through what often resembled digital communism—social credit scores, central bank digital currencies, and many more China-like policies. Meanwhile, cultural shifts across the Americas signal a rising movement toward traditional values, sending the WEF&apos;s ideological woke grip on governments, non-government organizations, corporations, the church, and society into disarray. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Following my recent announcement, and as I enter my 88th year, I have decided to step down from the position of Chair and as a member of the Board of Trustees, with immediate effect&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; Schwab wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/GpDLm6PXAAAJx7l.jpg?itok=XOyvofPt&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/GpDLm6PXAAAJx7l.jpg?itok=XOyvofPt&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;de6a6471-afd5-4154-a0cb-6e476561b8b1&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/GpDLm6PXAAAJx7l.jpg?itok=XOyvofPt&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwab stepped down as executive chairman one year ago (read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/wef-founder-klaus-schwab-stepping-down-executive-chairman&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), with former Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende taking over daily operations. WEF said Vice Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe was appointed board chairman in the interim and that a search committee for replacement had been appointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WEF stated: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At a time when the world is undergoing rapid transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the need for inclusive dialogue to navigate complexity and shape the future has never been more critical. The Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum underlines the importance of remaining steadfast in its mission and values as a facilitator of progress. Building on its trusted role, the Forum will continue to bring together leaders from all sectors and regions to exchange insights and foster collaboration.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might recognize some of the WEF&apos;s board members...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwab’s resignation also comes three months after President Trump told globalist CEOs at the WEF’s 2025 Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, “America is back.” It also follows Trump and Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative, which nuked USAID programs that funneled billions of taxpayer dollars into corrupt NGOs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Klaus Schwab Steps Down From WEF Board Amid Globalist Retreat

            
On the same day Pope Francis—known for his inclusive beliefs—passed away, another globalist fell: Klaus Schwab, the architect of the World Economic Forum&apos;s dystopian agenda, announced he was stepping down from the WEF board. It marks the end of an era for Schwab, who championed radical wokeness, bug eating, mass vaccination campaigns, population control, and climate de-growth policies through what often resembled digital communism—social credit scores, central bank digital currencies, and many more China-like policies. Meanwhile, cultural shifts across the Americas signal a rising movement toward traditional values, sending the WEF&apos;s ideological woke grip on governments, non-government organizations, corporations, the church, and society into disarray. 
&quot;Following my recent announcement, and as I enter my 88th year, I have decided to step down from the position of Chair and as a member of the Board of Trustees, with immediate effect,&quot; Schwab wrote in a statement. 



Schwab stepped down as executive chairman one year ago (read: here), with former Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende taking over daily operations. WEF said Vice Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe was appointed board chairman in the interim and that a search committee for replacement had been appointed.

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/abrego-garcia-moved-to-el-salvador-detention-facility-given-own-room-state-department-5844955?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Aldgra Fredly via The Epoch Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant who was deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been transferred from the country’s maximum-security prison to a detention facility, where he now has his own room, according to an April 20 court filing by the U.S. State Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2894%29_5.jpg?itok=bfJcANvj&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2894%29_5.jpg?itok=bfJcANvj&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;21be3f76-a5c6-4799-9db0-2ff88f209660&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2894%29_5.jpg?itok=bfJcANvj&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, illegally entered the United States in 2011 and was living in Maryland. He was arrested and deported to El Salvador in March for allegedly being a member of the MS-13 gang, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, despite an immigration judge having issued a withholding of removal—which legally barred his deportation to his home country—in 2019 due to concerns for his safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department &lt;a href=&quot;https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815.92.0.pdf&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Abrego Garcia was transferred from El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) to a facility in Santa Ana eight days before he met with U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) on April 17 during the senator’s visit to the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Abrego Garcia told Sen. Van Hollen that he had been placed in the administrative building of Centro Industrial, in a room of his own with a bed and furniture, and that he was not in a cell,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Michael Kozak, a senior official at the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Van Hollen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/maryland-senator-describes-meeting-with-abrego-garcia-in-el-salvador-5844223&quot;&gt;traveled&lt;/a&gt; to El Salvador last week to visit Abrego Garcia after Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said the man would not be returned to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the United States after it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/doj-says-administrative-error-resulted-in-deportation-of-gang-member-5834805&quot;&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that he was deported following an administrative error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration has said that it lacked the authority to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador as he was already in the custody of a foreign nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to reporters on April 16, Van Hollen said the Salvadoran government initially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/maryland-senator-says-el-salvador-denied-him-meeting-phone-call-with-deported-man-5842982&quot;&gt;denied him a visit&lt;/a&gt; or phone call with Abrego Garcia after meeting with the country’s Vice President Félix Ulloa. That visit occurred the following day when Salvadoran officials transported the man to the hotel where Van Hollen was staying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The senator has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/maryland-senator-describes-meeting-with-abrego-garcia-in-el-salvador-5844223&quot;&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration of defying court orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“When you defy court orders and deny one man his Constitutional rights, you threaten them for ALL,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Van Hollen &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/1914016624828694990&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; on social media, adding that there was no evidence linking Abrego Garcia to the MS-13 gang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has criticized Democrats whom he said were falsely portraying Abrego Garcia as an innocent person, saying that two courts have found him to be a member of “the violent, killer gang MS-13.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 18, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released documents detailing Abrego Garcia’s past encounters with law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the documents, Abrego Garcia was pulled over in Tennessee for speeding while carrying eight other individuals in a vehicle belonging to his employer in December 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No luggage was found in the vehicle. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the group’s three-day travel from Texas to Maryland “reek of human trafficking.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We hear far too much about the gang members and criminals’ false sob stories and not enough about their victims,” McLaughlin said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/04/18/dhs-releases-bombshell-investigative-report-kilmar-abrego-garcia-suspected-human&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. Abrego Garcia was not charged in the incident.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Abrego Garcia was identified by the Prince George’s County Police Department’s gang unit as a member of the MS-13 gang. He was later granted withholding of removal by an immigration judge, according to the DHS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Abrego Garcia Moved To Lower Security Detention Facility, Given Own Room: State Department

            
Authored by Aldgra Fredly via The Epoch Times,
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant who was deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been transferred from the country’s maximum-security prison to a detention facility, where he now has his own room, according to an April 20 court filing by the U.S. State Department.



Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, illegally entered the United States in 2011 and was living in Maryland. He was arrested and deported to El Salvador in March for allegedly being a member of the MS-13 gang, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, despite an immigration judge having issued a withholding of removal—which legally barred his deportation to his home country—in 2019 due to concerns for his safety.
The department said Abrego Garcia was transferred from El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) to a facility in Santa Ana eight days before he met with U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) on April 17 during the senator’s visit to the country.
“Abrego Garcia told Sen. Van Hollen that he had been placed in the administrative building of Centro Industrial, in a room of his own with a bed and furniture, and that he was not in a cell,” Michael Kozak, a senior official at the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said in the filing.
Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week to visit Abrego Garcia after Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said the man would not be returned to the United States.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the United States after it acknowledged that he was deported following an administrative error.
The administration has said that it lacked the authority to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador as he was already in the custody of a foreign nation.
Speaking to reporters on April 16, Van Hollen said the Salvadoran government initially denied him a visit or phone call with Abrego Garcia after meeting with the country’s Vice President Félix Ulloa. That visit occurred the following day when Salvadoran officials transported the man to the hotel where Van Hollen was staying.
The senator has accused the Trump administration of defying court orders.
“When you defy court orders and deny one man his Constitutional rights, you threaten them for ALL,” Van Hollen stated on social media, adding that there was no evidence linking Abrego Garcia to the MS-13 gang.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.
President Donald Trump has criticized Democrats whom he said were falsely portraying Abrego Garcia as an innocent person, saying that two courts have found him to be a member of “the violent, killer gang MS-13.”
“Those lying to the American People on behalf of violent criminals have to be held responsible by the Agencies and the Courts,” Trump stated in a Truth Social post on Sunday.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/ES%202025-04-21_7-54-49.jpg?itok=H5T0tL-j&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ES%202025-04-21_7-54-49.jpg?itok=H5T0tL-j&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;d3abf334-7190-43af-a222-54515df39abd&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ES%202025-04-21_7-54-49.jpg?itok=H5T0tL-j&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In premarket trading, the Mag 7 are lower, with Tesla the top decliner: TSLA plunged 4% after Wedbush analyst and a Tesla bull Dan Ives warns of a “code red” moment ahead of first-quarter earnings (the rest are also hurting NVDA -3.1%, META -1.3%, AAPL -2%, AMZN -1.7%, GOOGL -1.3% and MSFT -0.9%). Netflix climbed 2.4% after the streaming giant reported record profit to start the year, allaying concerns of a slowdown or fears the streaming leader might be hurt by growing economic uncertainty. Here are some other notable movers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) rises 2.7% after receiving approval from US regulators to buy Discover Financial Services, a deal that creates the nation’s biggest credit-card issuer by loan volume. Discover (DFS) gains 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Salesforce (CRM) declines 1.5% after D.A. Davidson downgraded the software company, saying it’s neglecting its core business to pursue a “premature” AI opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Spotify (SPOT) climbs 1% after Wolfe Research upgraded its rating, saying there “multiple paths to improved monetization.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor ADRs (TSM) drop 1.9% after the company listed challenges of ensuring export control compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, rightfully frustrated that the central bank hasn’t moved to lower interest rates as even BofA&apos;s Michael Hartnett &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/hartnett-amid-apocalyptic-sentiment-bullish-roadmap-emerges&quot;&gt;noted over the weekend&lt;/a&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fed cut 50bps in Sept when stock market at record high, Atlanta Fed was forecasting +3% US GDP growth; Fed now determined not to cut rates after 20% market plunge, Atlanta Fed forecasting -3% GDP growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... posted on social media last week that Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough!” and on Friday, Trump top economic advisor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-18/trump-studying-whether-removing-powell-is-option-hassett-says&quot;&gt;Kevin Hassett said &lt;/a&gt;the president is studying whether he’s able to fire Powell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebuking the Fed undermines the principle of central bank independence and risks politicizing US monetary policy in a way that markets will find deeply unsettling, said Christopher Wong, a currency strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. “Frankly, firing Powell stretches belief,” said Wong. “If the credibility of the Fed is called into question, it could severely erode confidence in the dollar.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump would put the credibility of the dollar on the line and destabilize the US economy if he fired Powell, French Finance Minister Eric Lombard warned. Fed Chicago President Austan Goolsbee warned against efforts to curtail the central bank’s independence. “There’s virtual unanimity among economists that monetary independence from political interference, that the Fed or any central bank be able to do the job that it needs to do, is really important,” Goolsbee said on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sign that investors are rotating investments away from the US, Deutsche Bank AG said that Chinese clients have reduced some of their Treasuries holdings in favor of European debt. European high-quality bonds, Japanese government bonds and gold are likely to be the potential choices for investors as alternatives to Treasuries, said Lillian Tao, head of China macro and global emerging market sales at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tariff news, China’s largest shipping line, Cosco Shipping, said the US plans to impose levies on Chinese vessels docking at US ports would erode stability in global trade and supply chains. China has vowed to use its big market to help companies cope with “external shocks.” Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party is said to be set to make an emergency proposal in the wake of the US tariffs, urging the government to strengthen loan support for companies and boost domestic demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In FX, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slid 0.8% on Monday to a 9 month low, its worst day in 2 weeks. Every Group-of-10 currency gained against the greenback. The jump in the yen weighed on stock indexes in Japan, pushing the Nikkei 225 down 1.3%. The yen, euro and Swiss franc rallied. Brent fell as much as 2% to below $67 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rates, the Treasury yield curve steepened  with two-year notes rallying as longer maturities tumbled. That suggests investors are betting on the chance of interest rate cuts and reflecting concerns over long-term US assets. The Treasury curve pivots around a near unchanged 5-year sector, with the twist steepening move widening 2s10s, 5s30s spreads by 6.5bp and 6bp on the day, adding to Thursday’s steepening momentum. US 10-year yields trade around 4.40%, cheaper by 8bp vs. Thursday close. According to Bloomberg, price action continues around a narrative of declining dollar and US stock futures amid continued concerns that President Donald Trump will fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Added premium for Fed cuts seen in front-end, where swaps now price around 90bp of easing for the year vs. 85bp priced last week. European markets also shut for Easter Monday.  Treasury auctions resume Tuesday with $69 billion 2-year notes, followed by $70 billion 5-year and $44 billion 7-year Wednesday and Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In commodities, oil retreated as traders fretted over the impact of the US-led trade war on energy demand, while sings of progress in talks between Washington and Tehran eased concerns about supplies from Iran. WTI crude traded down 2.4% to $62.50, erasing much of Friday&apos;s gain. Meanwhile gold continues to print record highs, rising above $3400 amid collapsing confidence in fiat currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while gold&apos;s surge was to be expected, the most notable move overnight is that bitcoin finally snapped higher, breaking its recent correlation with the dollar (and inverse correlation with the yen due to its carry trade funding), and surged above $87,000, suggesting a sharp move higher in bitcoin may be imminent, especially once other central banks start easing to offset the collapse in the USD.&lt;/p&gt;

The Treasury curve pivots around a near unchanged 5-year sector, with the twist steepening move widening 2s10s, 5s30s spreads by 6.5bp and 6bp on the day, adding to Thursday’s steepening momentum. US 10-year yields trade around 4.40%, cheaper by 8bp vs. Thursday close. According to Bloomberg, price action continues around a narrative of declining dollar and US stock futures amid continued concerns that President Donald Trump will fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Added premium for Fed cuts seen in front-end, where swaps now price around 90bp of easing for the year vs. 85bp priced last week. European markets also shut for Easter Monday.  Treasury auctions resume Tuesday with $69 billion 2-year notes, followed by $70 billion 5-year and $44 billion 7-year Wednesday and Thursday.
In commodities, oil retreated as traders fretted over the impact of the US-led trade war on energy demand, while sings of progress in talks between Washington and Tehran eased concerns about supplies from Iran. WTI crude traded down 2.4% to $62.50, erasing much of Friday&apos;s gain. Meanwhile gold continues to print record highs, rising above $3400 amid collapsing confidence in fiat currencies.
But while gold&apos;s surge was to be expected, the most notable move overnight is that bitcoin finally snapped higher, breaking its recent correlation with the dollar (and inverse correlation with the yen due to its carry trade funding), and surged above $87,000, suggesting a sharp move higher in bitcoin may be imminent, especially once other central banks start easing to offset the collapse in the USD.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media that peddled the Russia hoax,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Hegseth said, responding to new reporting from The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&quot;This is what the media does. They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former… &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/sz8cjm01MP&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/sz8cjm01MP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations,” Hegseth continued. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Not gonna work with me. &lt;strong&gt;Because we’re changing the Defense Department. Putting the Pentagon back in the hands of warfighters.&lt;/strong&gt; And anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesn’t matter. So I’m happy to be here at the Easter Egg Roll with my dad and my kids.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Monday that the president “absolutely has confidence” in Hegseth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I spoke to him about it this morning, and he stands strongly behind him,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Leavitt said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the fake news refused to drop it and so conjured up a bullshit story that The White House has begun a search for a new SecDef (NPR reported, according to a person familiar). Leavitt was quick to destroy that narrative completely...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*  *  *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is taking heavy fire once again.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In what looks like a coordinated attack&lt;/strong&gt;, Sunday brought a sensational new allegation of Hegseth violating operational security (OPSEC) ahead of the March 15 US strikes on Yemen, and an op-ed from a former Hegseth advocate calling for his removal over &quot;total chaos at the Pentagon.&quot; While it&apos;s hard to discern motives in DC&apos;s &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; intrigue, the renewed assault comes after &lt;strong&gt;Hegseth reportedly helped dissuade President Trump from launching Israel&apos;s long-pursued US war on Iran&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, Hegseth found himself in the middle of a media and political firestorm after &lt;strong&gt;he unwittingly shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-atlantic-war-plans-signal-yemen-houthis-c0addd08c627ab01a37ea63621cb695e&quot;&gt;detailed information&lt;/a&gt; about pending US strikes on Yemen with &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; editor Jeffrey Goldberg&lt;/strong&gt; -- who was errantly added to a Signal group chat for top officials by national security advisor Mike Waltz . Hegseth didn&apos;t do himself any favors by downplaying the report and attempting to obfuscate the facts of the scandal -- for example, using wordplay to claim &quot;nobody was texting war plans,&quot; but rather minute-by-minute details of the attack. Goldberg&apos;s inclusion aside, &lt;strong&gt;the use of a common smartphone app to discuss such sensitive details was controversial by itself&lt;/strong&gt;, raising concerns not only about OPSEC, but also records retention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to Sunday, when a double-tap attack on Hegseth&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;started with a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report that&lt;strong&gt; Hegseth shared substantially identical, advance details about the March 15 strikes with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/hegseth-yemen-attack-second-signal-chat.html&quot;&gt;a second Signal chat group&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-signal-chat-houthis-attack-8dbf9dd6c711796438a5c1c84831c40b&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; members included his wife Jennifer, brother Phil and personal lawyer Tim Parlatore&lt;/strong&gt;. Citing four sources familiar with this group chat and its contents, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/hegseth-yemen-attack-second-signal-chat.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that this group -- labelled &quot;Defense/Team Huddle&quot; -- was created by Hegseth himself, who accessed it with his private phone, not his government one.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While his personal lawyer and brother have DOD jobs, neither seemingly had a &quot;need to know&quot; about the attacks. Hegseth appointed Parlatore as a Navy Reserve JAG Commander, with a focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/05/us/trump-news?searchResultPosition=7#hegseths-personal-lawyer-to-be-commissioned-as-a-navy-commander-in-the-reserves&quot;&gt;improving the training&lt;/a&gt; of JAG officers. Phil Hegseth is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2025/03/28/hegseths-younger-brother-is-serving-in-a-key-role-inside-the-pentagon/&quot;&gt;DOD liaison with the Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; -- a post that hardly suggests a need to know about the imminent strike, much less a timeline &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-atlantic-war-plans-signal-yemen-houthis-c0addd08c627ab01a37ea63621cb695e&quot;&gt;detailing&lt;/a&gt; that F-18s, MQ-9 Reaper drones and Tomahawk cruise missiles would be used. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;strong&gt;this scenario seems to indicate a Secretary of Defense excitedly and unjustifiably sharing inside info with his wife and confidants&lt;/strong&gt;. Validating his confirmation-opponents&apos; attacks on his lack of experience, the decision seems consistent with a SecDef whose own top military rank was &lt;a href=&quot;https://ballotpedia.org/Pete_Hegseth&quot;&gt;Major&lt;/a&gt; in the National Guard. Meanwhile, the Signal chat about Yemen isn&apos;t the first time &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Hegseth&apos;s involvement in her husband&apos;s job has raised eyebrows&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/hegseth-brought-his-wife-to-sensitive-meetings-with-foreign-military-officials-c16db0ea&quot;&gt;Questions have also been raised over why Jennifer -- a former &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt; producer with no DOD job -- has participated in multiple meetings that covered sensitive topics&lt;/a&gt;, including one with the head of UK&apos;s military to discuss terminating the sharing of intelligence with Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/ullyot-hegseth.jpeg?itok=U5CzzD2i&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ullyot-hegseth.jpeg?itok=U5CzzD2i&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;5e3eb579-67b8-416f-bdbb-8122c1b76f04&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;318&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ullyot-hegseth.jpeg?itok=U5CzzD2i&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Ullyot -- who publicly advocated for Hegseth&apos;s confirmation -- now says Trump should dump him over Pentagon &quot;dysfunction&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second half of the weekend blitz against Hegseth came in the form of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/04/20/pentagon-chaos-ullyot-hegseth-00205594&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; op-ed written by John Ullyot&lt;/strong&gt;, a former champion of Hegseth who resigned from a Department of Defense public affairs role last month. He described the last month as &quot;total chaos at the Pentagon,&quot; saying that, given President Trump&apos;s &quot;strong record of holding his top officials to account...&lt;strong&gt;it’s hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role&lt;/strong&gt; for much longer.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the poor OPSEC of &quot;Signalgate&quot; and Hegseth&apos;s attempt to use a &quot;vague, Clinton-esque non-denial denial&quot; of the scandal, Hegseth focused on &lt;strong&gt;last week&apos;s firing of three top Pentagon staffers&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;senior adviser Dan Caldwell, deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick and chief of staff Colin Carroll. Ullyot wrote that Hegseth loyalists &quot;tried to smear the aides anonymously,&quot; dishonestly accusing them of leaking sensitive information. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Hegseth’s team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; wrote Ullyot. The &quot;strange and baffling purge&quot; is causing &quot;disarray,&quot; wrote Ullyot, who also called out the odd inclusion of Hegseth&apos;s wife in sensitive meetings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;The president deserves better than the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://jel.jewish-languages.org/words/382&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;mishegoss&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the Pentagon,&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;concluded Ullyot. &quot;Given his record of holding prior Cabinet leaders accountable, many in the secretary’s own inner circle will applaud quietly if Trump [fires Hegseth].&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No matter how much credence you attach to substance of these attacks on Hegseth, it&apos;s smart to consider the possible motives&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;of those who are participating in them:&lt;/strong&gt; the four people volunteering details about the newly-revealed Signal group chat, Hegseth cheerleader-turned-assailant John Ullyot, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and especially &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; -- an outlet with a record of advancing the Deep State agenda. (Never forget the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/hunter-biden-story-russian-disinfo-430276&quot;&gt;Oct 19 2020 &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; headline: &quot;Hunter Biden Story is Russian Disinfo, Dozens of Former Intel Officials Say.&quot;)   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On one front, Hegseth is going all-out on behalf of the national security apparatus&lt;/strong&gt;, joining Trump in a campaign to throw perhaps every dollar of DOGE savings into a Pentagon rathole in a bid to push the DOD budget beyond $1 trillion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Thank you Mr. President!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

— Pete Hegseth (@PeteHegseth) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PeteHegseth/status/1909362824935358610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 7, 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;Hegseth may be an intolerable Deep State disappointment on a far more important front -- failing to deliver the US war on Iran that&apos;s been a decades-long ambition of the State of Israel &lt;/strong&gt;and its American collaborators. Last week, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-israel-iran-nuclear.html&quot;&gt;Trump killed an Israeli proposal for a US-facilitated, week-long IDF bombing campaign on Iranian nuclear facilities in May, attributing the decision to key naysayers that included Hegseth&lt;/a&gt;, Vice President JD Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. Contemplating the specter of such an attack sparking an all-out war, Trump opted to give diplomacy a chance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&apos;s the last thing many Deep State power brokers want.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>President Trump &quot;Stands Strongly Behind&quot; Hegseth; White House Denies NPR&apos;s &quot;Fake News&quot; Story On New SecDef Search

            
Update (1030ET): SecDef Hegseth is not taking these new allegations sitting down, lashing out at “disgruntled former employees” for leaks and reassuring that he and President Trump are “on the same page all the way.”
“What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media that peddled the Russia hoax,” Hegseth said, responding to new reporting from The New York Times.
NEW: @PeteHegseth at the White House Easter Egg Roll dismisses an attempt to revive Signal-Gate, suggesting recently-fired DOD employees are the anonymous sources for new stories on the topic

“This is what the media does. They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations,” Hegseth continued. 
“Not gonna work with me. Because we’re changing the Defense Department. Putting the Pentagon back in the hands of warfighters. And anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesn’t matter. So I’m happy to be here at the Easter Egg Roll with my dad and my kids.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Monday that the president “absolutely has confidence” in Hegseth. 
“I spoke to him about it this morning, and he stands strongly behind him,” Leavitt said.
Of course, the fake news refused to drop it and so conjured up a bullshit story that The White House has begun a search for a new SecDef (NPR reported, according to a person familiar). Leavitt was quick to destroy that narrative completely...
This ⁦@NPR⁩ story is total FAKE NEWS based on one anonymous source who clearly has no idea what they are talking about.

As the President said this morning, he stands strongly behind ⁦@SecDef⁩. https://t.co/5Npig8968v

Administration officials have insisted there was no classified information shared in either chat.
*  *  *
Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is taking heavy fire once again. In what looks like a coordinated attack, Sunday brought a sensational new allegation of Hegseth violating operational security (OPSEC) ahead of the March 15 US strikes on Yemen, and an op-ed from a former Hegseth advocate calling for his removal over &quot;total chaos at the Pentagon.&quot; While it&apos;s hard to discern motives in DC&apos;s House of Cards intrigue, the renewed assault comes after Hegseth reportedly helped dissuade President Trump from launching Israel&apos;s long-pursued US war on Iran. 
Last month, Hegseth found himself in the middle of a media and political firestorm after he unwittingly shared detailed information about pending US strikes on Yemen with Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg -- who was errantly added to a Signal group chat for top officials by national security advisor Mike Waltz . Hegseth didn&apos;t do himself any favors by downplaying the report and attempting to obfuscate the facts of the scandal -- for example, using wordplay to claim &quot;nobody was texting war plans,&quot; but rather minute-by-minute details of the attack. Goldberg&apos;s inclusion aside, the use of a common smartphone app to discuss such sensitive details was controversial by itself, raising concerns not only about OPSEC, but also records retention. 
Did civilian Jennifer Hegseth have a need to know the 1st strike package of F-18s would launch at 12:15 ET on March 15, and that &quot;THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP&quot; AT 1415, as Hegseth texted her and his brother? 


Fast-forward to Sunday, when a double-tap attack on Hegseth started with a New York Times report that Hegseth shared substantially identical, advance details about the March 15 strikes with a second Signal chat group, whose 13 members included his wife Jennifer, brother Phil and personal lawyer Tim Parlatore. Citing four sources familiar with this group chat and its contents, the Times reported that this group -- labelled &quot;Defense/Team Huddle&quot; -- was created by Hegseth himself, who accessed it with his private phone, not his government one.  
While his personal lawyer and brother have DOD jobs, neither seemingly had a &quot;need to know&quot; about the attacks. Hegseth appointed Parlatore as a Navy Reserve JAG Commander, with a focus on improving the training of JAG officers. Phil Hegseth is a DOD liaison with the Department of Homeland Security -- a post that hardly suggests a need to know about the imminent strike, much less a timeline detailing that F-18s, MQ-9 Reaper drones and Tomahawk cruise missiles would be used. 
In other words, this scenario seems to indicate a Secretary of Defense excitedly and unjustifiably sharing inside info with his wife and confidants. Validating his confirmation-opponents&apos; attacks on his lack of experience, the decision seems consistent with a SecDef whose own top military rank was Major in the National Guard. Meanwhile, the Signal chat about Yemen isn&apos;t the first time Jennifer Hegseth&apos;s involvement in her husband&apos;s job has raised eyebrows. Questions have also been raised over why Jennifer -- a former Fox News producer with no DOD job -- has participated in multiple meetings that covered sensitive topics, including one with the head of UK&apos;s military to discuss terminating the sharing of intelligence with Ukraine. 
John Ullyot -- who publicly advocated for Hegseth&apos;s confirmation -- now says Trump should dump him over Pentagon &quot;dysfunction&quot;


The second half of the weekend blitz against Hegseth came in the form of a Politico op-ed written by John Ullyot, a former champion of Hegseth who resigned from a Department of Defense public affairs role last month. He described the last month as &quot;total chaos at the Pentagon,&quot; saying that, given President Trump&apos;s &quot;strong record of holding his top officials to account...it’s hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer.&quot; 
In addition to the poor OPSEC of &quot;Signalgate&quot; and Hegseth&apos;s attempt to use a &quot;vague, Clinton-esque non-denial denial&quot; of the scandal, Hegseth focused on last week&apos;s firing of three top Pentagon staffers: senior adviser Dan Caldwell, deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick and chief of staff Colin Carroll. Ullyot wrote that Hegseth loyalists &quot;tried to smear the aides anonymously,&quot; dishonestly accusing them of leaking sensitive information. &quot;Hegseth’s team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door,&quot; wrote Ullyot. The &quot;strange and baffling purge&quot; is causing &quot;disarray,&quot; wrote Ullyot, who also called out the odd inclusion of Hegseth&apos;s wife in sensitive meetings. 
&quot;The president deserves better than the current mishegoss at the Pentagon,&quot; concluded Ullyot. &quot;Given his record of holding prior Cabinet leaders accountable, many in the secretary’s own inner circle will applaud quietly if Trump [fires Hegseth].&quot; 
No matter how much credence you attach to substance of these attacks on Hegseth, it&apos;s smart to consider the possible motives of those who are participating in them: the four people volunteering details about the newly-revealed Signal group chat, Hegseth cheerleader-turned-assailant John Ullyot, the New York Times, and especially Politico -- an outlet with a record of advancing the Deep State agenda. (Never forget the Oct 19 2020 Politico headline: &quot;Hunter Biden Story is Russian Disinfo, Dozens of Former Intel Officials Say.&quot;)   
On one front, Hegseth is going all-out on behalf of the national security apparatus, joining Trump in a campaign to throw perhaps every dollar of DOGE savings into a Pentagon rathole in a bid to push the DOD budget beyond $1 trillion:
Thank you Mr. President!

COMING SOON: the first TRILLION dollar @DeptofDefense budget.

President @realDonaldTrump is rebuilding our military — and FAST.

However, Hegseth may be an intolerable Deep State disappointment on a far more important front -- failing to deliver the US war on Iran that&apos;s been a decades-long ambition of the State of Israel and its American collaborators. Last week, the Times reported that Trump killed an Israeli proposal for a US-facilitated, week-long IDF bombing campaign on Iranian nuclear facilities in May, attributing the decision to key naysayers that included Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. Contemplating the specter of such an attack sparking an all-out war, Trump opted to give diplomacy a chance. 
That&apos;s the last thing many Deep State power brokers want.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/18/europe/rubio-russia-war-in-ukraine-us-talks-intl-hnk/index.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that the US might stop mediating an end to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thealtworld.com/andrew_korybko/heres-what-i-learned-from-analyzing-the-new-cold-war-every-day-for-three-years-straight&quot;&gt;Ukrainian Conflict&lt;/a&gt; if it concludes within “a matter of days” that no peace deal is doable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That coincided with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/hdOfc&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; reporting that Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff told them that “Putin had been fixated on Ukrainian land in their discussions. He said that Russia might get some of the regions, but not all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis &lt;a href=&quot;https://korybko.substack.com/p/lavrov-elaborated-on-russias-envisaged&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; explained why it’s so important for Russia to obtain full control over the disputed lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If no breakthrough is achieved, such as the US coercing Ukraine into withdrawing from those regions or Russia agreeing to freeze this dimension of the conflict, then the US might indeed abandon its peace efforts. &lt;/strong&gt;The question therefore arises of how that could change its relations with Ukraine and Russia. Beginning with the first, Trump and his team’s explicitly expressed exhaustion with this conflict bodes ill for the scenario of the US continuing military support for Ukraine, which would please Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Europeans would try to replace some of this lost aid&lt;/strong&gt; in order to keep the conflict going in alignment with Zelensky’s vision, but they’d be unable to replace all of it and he might ultimately be forced into agreeing to worse terms than the US’ if Russia successfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://korybko.substack.com/p/will-russia-expand-its-ground-campaign&quot;&gt;expands its ground offensive&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, however, the US might also suspend its talks with Russia on the strategic resource deals that were supposed to serve as the centerpiece of their planned “&lt;a href=&quot;https://korybko.substack.com/p/russia-and-the-us-diplomatic-choreography&quot;&gt;New&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://korybko.substack.com/p/korybko-to-newsweek-a-russian-us&quot;&gt;Détente&lt;/a&gt;” as long as the conflict continues&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This balanced approach would be predicated on pressuring Ukraine and Russia into committing to compromises aimed at restoring the US-led peace talks since the first doesn’t want to lose territory in other regions while the second is interested in shaping the post-conflict era in partnership with the US. These evidently aren’t their top priorities, however, otherwise the land issue would have already been resolved one way or another and there wouldn’t be any talk of the US abandoning its peace efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other than the unlikely scenario of the US “escalating to de-escalate” on better terms for Ukraine, another comparatively more probable one exists but which is still less likely than the aforesaid, and that’s the US discontinuing military support for Ukraine but continuing resource talks with Russia.&lt;/strong&gt; These negotiations are connected to Ukraine since the US is seeking privileged terms from Russia in exchange for coercing Kiev into Moscow’s demanded concessions but can still proceed even if that doesn’t occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why this scenario is considered less likely than the balanced one described above is because some of the US’ sanctions that impede the clinching of resource deals with Russia can’t easily be lifted without first bringing about an end to the Ukrainian Conflict. Moreover, sanctions relief and the prospect of jointly shaping the post-conflict era are the only carrots that the US can dangle for incentivizing Russia to compromise on ending the conflict, which Trump wants it to do for solidifying his global legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s therefore expected to at least temporarily suspend such talks with Russia for that reason in that scenario but might resume them if the conflict remains protracted with no clear diplomatic or military solution. That would make the most sense since &lt;strong&gt;he wouldn’t prematurely give up the only means that the US has for incentivizing Russia to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thealtworld.com/andrew_korybko/will-putin-agree-to-a-ceasefire&quot;&gt;compromise for peace&lt;/a&gt; but he also wouldn’t lose the objective economic and strategic benefits that a resource deal would bring.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>How Might Washington&apos;s Relations With Ukraine &amp; Russia Change If It Abandons Its Peace Efforts?

            
Authored by Andrew Korybko via substack,
The US might cut off military aid to Ukraine while suspending its strategic resource talks with Russia...



Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday that the US might stop mediating an end to the Ukrainian Conflict if it concludes within “a matter of days” that no peace deal is doable.
That coincided with the Wall Street Journal reporting that Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff told them that “Putin had been fixated on Ukrainian land in their discussions. He said that Russia might get some of the regions, but not all.”

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/dxy%20dollar%20index%202.jpg?itok=mdtOyQBR&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/dxy%20dollar%20index%202.jpg?itok=mdtOyQBR&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;2b2d59b5-55c8-4586-ae76-8bfc0dfb549f&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;312&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/dxy%20dollar%20index%202.jpg?itok=mdtOyQBR&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no specific catalyst for the suddenly collapse in the illiquid early Asian session, which sees many countries on extended Easter holiday, Bloomberg quotes traders that hedge funds are selling the dollar against virtually any currencies after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that President Donald Trump is still exploring ways to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The president and his team will continue to study that,” National Economic Council Director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-18/trump-studying-whether-removing-powell-is-option-hassett-says&quot;&gt;Kevin Hassett said Friday&lt;/a&gt; when asked by a reporter if removing Powell was an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hassett then suggested, accurately, that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The policy of this Federal Reserve was to raise rates the minute President Trump was elected last time, to say that the supply-side tax cuts that were going to be inflationary,” Hassett said, adding that Fed officials opted not to go “on TV and at IMF meetings and warn about the terrible inflation from the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden, and the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden was textbook inflationary,” Hassett continued. “And then they cut rates right ahead of the election.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hassett, is of course, correct, as we first pointed out two weeks ago...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... the Yen surging 11% from its January lows, and at just over 141, the highest it has been against the dollar since the summer of 2023...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=8dJuF5ff&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=8dJuF5ff&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;6ba74330-a6a9-4143-b749-e83364dc6640&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=8dJuF5ff&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and, of course, gold which is storming to new record highs this evening, spiking above $3,373, its dip last week now a distant memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/gold%20usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=fWXgLfSJ&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/gold%20usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=fWXgLfSJ&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;085b99b0-98ad-4095-af14-4d3cfa11c1cd&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/gold%20usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=fWXgLfSJ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet none of these moves are surprising to anyone who read - as we repeatedly urged - the Miran Mar-A-Lago paper: yes, the plunge in the dollar is just what the admin quietly wants (they have repeatedly stated they want a strong dollar &quot;in the long term&quot;, but certainly not in the short, when the collapse in the greenback will boost US exports). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, if Powell will not cut rates to ease financial conditions, Trump&apos;s repeated browbeating of the Fed chair and threats to fire him will crash the dollar low enough to where Trump will get his financial easing one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there was one notable outlier in tonight&apos;s Dollar selloff: bitcoin. While previously any plunge in the dollar (and by extension surge in the yen) would batter what was little is left of the carry trade, hammering tech stocks and cryptos, tonight we finally saw a regime shift, and after flatlining initially, a burst of buying pushed bitcoin almost $2000 higher, above $87000, and its biggest one day move since Liberation Day...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/bitcoin%20snaps.jpg?itok=aSFVJ-X-&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/bitcoin%20snaps.jpg?itok=aSFVJ-X-&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;8a912e88-4dca-4189-a077-3f3e4c659fcc&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/bitcoin%20snaps.jpg?itok=aSFVJ-X-&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and the result is that while bitcoin had generally tracked the DXY Dollar index lower for much of 2025, the last few weeks - and certainly Sunday night - have seen a very tangible snap in this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/dollar%20vs%20bitcoin.jpg?itok=tHC7FNse&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/dollar%20vs%20bitcoin.jpg?itok=tHC7FNse&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;b4402399-1624-4822-b5da-8685d600ed39&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/dollar%20vs%20bitcoin.jpg?itok=tHC7FNse&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This breach in the right correlation between the two, suggests that with gold approaching ridiculous prices, the next flight to safety away from the collapsing dollar will be bitcoin - after all, &lt;strong&gt;it&apos;s only a matter of time before all other central banks unleash a money printing frenzy to hammer their own currencies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since all bitcoin needs is a little unexpected upside to spark a huge short squeeze and to get the momentum trades piling on, should today&apos;s phase reversal sustain for a few days, we may see new all time highs in bitcoin in a very short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait... because the real fun for non-fiat assets will start once other central banks - such as the BOJ and ECB - can no longer just sit and watch as the dollar disintegrates, pushing their own currencies into the stratosphere and killing their economies... and they retaliate by restarting the next round of global fiat debasement first by slashing rates and then by restarting the money printer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Dollar Crashes On Powell Removal Speculation, Gold Soars To All Time High And Bitcoin Suddenly Spikes

            
What was a miserable shortened week for the USD has gone from bad to worse in early Asia trading, when the Dollar index suddenly collapsed to a fresh 3 year low



While there is no specific catalyst for the suddenly collapse in the illiquid early Asian session, which sees many countries on extended Easter holiday, Bloomberg quotes traders that hedge funds are selling the dollar against virtually any currencies after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that President Donald Trump is still exploring ways to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to traders.
“The president and his team will continue to study that,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday when asked by a reporter if removing Powell was an option.
Hassett then suggested, accurately, that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats.
“The policy of this Federal Reserve was to raise rates the minute President Trump was elected last time, to say that the supply-side tax cuts that were going to be inflationary,” Hassett said, adding that Fed officials opted not to go “on TV and at IMF meetings and warn about the terrible inflation from the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden, and the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden was textbook inflationary,” Hassett continued. “And then they cut rates right ahead of the election.”
Hassett, is of course, correct, as we first pointed out two weeks ago...

... as Bank of America&apos;s Michael Hartnett pointed out on Friday...
Fed cut 50bps in Sept when stock market at record high, Atlanta Fed was forecasting +3% US GDP growth; Fed now determined not to cut rates after 20% market plunge, Atlanta Fed forecasting -3% GDP growth
... and as former NY Fed president Bill Dudley made crystal clear all the way back in 2019.
The day is August 27, 2019. Former NY Fed president Bill Dudley writes a Bloomberg oped saying &quot;the Fed shouldn&apos;t enable Donald Trump&quot; and urged the central bank not to &quot;provide offsetting stimulus&quot; in Trump&apos;s trade war with China.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;The Failure Of The Expert Class... Again&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amgreatness.com/2025/04/19/the-failure-of-the-expert-classagain/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Stephen Soukup via American Greatness,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week, &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; ran an excellent, helpful, and important &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/school-closures-predictable-disaster/682431/?taid=68010ce6a6bd180001eec999&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_content=true-anthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by David Zweig, excerpted from his forthcoming book &lt;em&gt;An Abundance of Caution&lt;/em&gt;, which is, at least superficially, about the coronavirus pandemic and the school closures it prompted. &lt;strong&gt;Zweig denies that it is about the pandemic specifically, saying that it is, rather, about “&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davidzweig/status/1912883364064903303&quot;&gt;the failure of the expert class&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever the case, Zweig is unsparing in his criticism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without sufficient acknowledgment of the harms of school closures or adequate planning for unwinding this intervention, officials showed that their decisions to close were simply reactive rather than carefully considered. The decision makers set a radical project in motion with no plan on how to stop it. In effect, officials steered a car off the road, threw a cinder block on the accelerator, then jumped out of the vehicle with passengers still in the back. No one was in the front or even knew how to unstick the pedal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The main point of Zweig’s case is that the so-called expert class was not particularly expert in this instance, which is to say that the damage it did was predictable and therefore preventable. &lt;/strong&gt;Those in charge, whom we were all urged constantly to “trust,” were either ignorant of existing literature warning of the consequences of the actions they were taking or arrogant enough to think that they could produce outcomes different from those previously forecast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the end, the “experts” failed the nation and especially its children, who suffered disproportionately from their arrogance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_14-30-28.jpg?itok=rKTT3xym&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_14-30-28.jpg?itok=rKTT3xym&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;3e144270-6fe3-4a1c-8b8d-d7baaddeb044&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-20_14-30-28.jpg?itok=rKTT3xym&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zweig is right, almost inarguably, and I look forward to reading his book. Nevertheless, I would take his case even a step further, suggesting that the problem is bigger than an arrogant and out-of-touch expert class. The problem, rather, is the largely unique American tradition that insists that expertise and politics must be distinct from one another, and that when they clash, &lt;strong&gt;the narrowness of expertise must take precedence over the girth and depth of the democratic crowd.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID pandemic is not the first time that the American people have been let down and dragged down a dark road by their purportedly brilliant experts. Indeed, the defining event of the Baby Boom generation is, perhaps, the greatest (though hardly the only) example of previous “failures of the expert class.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Americans’ faith in experts and the expert class likely hit its zenith in the 1950s, a decade in which almost anything seemed possible. &lt;/strong&gt;America had defeated the Nazis and Imperial Japanese. It had rescued Europe from its war and the post-war destruction. It was strong and tough and, of course, it possessed the brightest scientists and the mightiest weapons in all of human history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On his best-known solo album, &lt;em&gt;The Nightfly&lt;/em&gt;, Steely Dan co-founder Donald Fagen reminisced about those days and the promise they held. For example, in “I.G.Y.,” he muses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing tough under stars and stripes&lt;br /&gt;
We can tell&lt;br /&gt;
This dream’s in sight&lt;br /&gt;
You’ve got to admit it&lt;br /&gt;
At this point in time that it’s clear&lt;br /&gt;
The future looks bright&lt;br /&gt;
On that train all graphite and glitter&lt;br /&gt;
Undersea by rail&lt;br /&gt;
Ninety minutes from New York to Paris&lt;br /&gt;
Well by seventy-six we’ll be A. O. K….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A just machine to make big decisions&lt;br /&gt;
Programmed by fellows with compassion and vision&lt;br /&gt;
We’ll be clean when their work is done&lt;br /&gt;
We’ll be eternally free yes and eternally young….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The I, the G, and the Y in the title of Fagen’s song refer to the “International Geophysical Year,” which was an 18-month-long scientific exchange celebration that ran from July 1957 to December 1958. The project was meant to take advantage of a reprieve in Cold War tensions to demonstrate to the world how science could produce lasting peace and harmony. The Soviets spoiled the peace and harmony bit by launching Sputnik three months later, sooner than the Americans could launch their satellite propelled by the rockets of Project Vanguard. In a fitting twist to the utopian agitprop of the IGY project, in response to Sputnik and to Vanguard’s failures, the United States turned, at last, to one of its greatest “experts” on rocket design, the erstwhile Nazi Wernher von Braun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course, most Americans didn’t know about Braun, and so their illusions about the “experts” remained unshattered&lt;/strong&gt;. In 1960, they elected a man and an administration that would come to epitomize the hope and the faith they placed in their experts. David Halberstam put it as follows in his classic &lt;em&gt;The Best and the Brightest&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We seemed about to enter an Olympian age in this country, brains and intellect harnessed to great force, the better to define a common good… It seems long ago now, that excitement which swept through the country, or at least the intellectual reaches of it, that feeling that America was going to change, that the government had been handed down from the tired, flabby chamber-of-commerce mentality of the Eisenhower years to the best and brightest of a generation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Fates and Nemesis would have it, however, it was the best and brightest who, in their arrogance and insularity, eventually shattered the expertise illusion with their debacle in Vietnam. Again, Halberstam wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no small irony here: An administration which flaunted its intellectual superiority and its superior academic credentials made the most critical of decisions with virtually no input from anyone who had any expertise on the recent history of that part of the world, and it in no way factored in the entire experience of the French Indochina War. Part of the reason for this were the upheavals of the McCarthy period, but in part it was also the arrogance of men of the Atlantic; it was as if these men did not need to know about such a distant and somewhat less worthy part of the world. Lesser parts of the world attracted lesser men; years later I came upon a story which illustrated this theory perfectly. Jack Langguth, a writer and college classmate of mine, mentioned to a member of that Administration that he was thinking of going on to study Latin American history. The man had turned to him, his contempt barely concealed, and said, “Second-rate parts of the world for second-rate minds.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle between the “rule of experts” and the rule of the people dates, like most of the dreadful battles in our society, to the dawn of the Progressive Era and the musings of Richard Ely and Woodrow Wilson. The expert class they envisioned proved to be a disaster, just as the Best and the Brightest did—and just as the health and education experts did during COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As I say, the problem here isn’t expertise &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. Expertise is invaluable, obviously. Rather, the problem is the belief that expertise conveys both infallibility and moral superiority and, therefore, should—always and everywhere—be considered superior to the will of the people.&lt;/strong&gt; Again, this is an artifact of Progressivism, and as important and insightful as books like David Zweig’s may be, they will not alter the dysfunctional operation of our system until we address this original sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <contentSnippet>The Failure Of The Expert Class... Again

            
Authored by Stephen Soukup via American Greatness,
This past week, The Atlantic ran an excellent, helpful, and important piece by David Zweig, excerpted from his forthcoming book An Abundance of Caution, which is, at least superficially, about the coronavirus pandemic and the school closures it prompted. Zweig denies that it is about the pandemic specifically, saying that it is, rather, about “the failure of the expert class.” Whatever the case, Zweig is unsparing in his criticism:
Without sufficient acknowledgment of the harms of school closures or adequate planning for unwinding this intervention, officials showed that their decisions to close were simply reactive rather than carefully considered. The decision makers set a radical project in motion with no plan on how to stop it. In effect, officials steered a car off the road, threw a cinder block on the accelerator, then jumped out of the vehicle with passengers still in the back. No one was in the front or even knew how to unstick the pedal.
The main point of Zweig’s case is that the so-called expert class was not particularly expert in this instance, which is to say that the damage it did was predictable and therefore preventable. Those in charge, whom we were all urged constantly to “trust,” were either ignorant of existing literature warning of the consequences of the actions they were taking or arrogant enough to think that they could produce outcomes different from those previously forecast. 
In the end, the “experts” failed the nation and especially its children, who suffered disproportionately from their arrogance.



Zweig is right, almost inarguably, and I look forward to reading his book. Nevertheless, I would take his case even a step further, suggesting that the problem is bigger than an arrogant and out-of-touch expert class. The problem, rather, is the largely unique American tradition that insists that expertise and politics must be distinct from one another, and that when they clash, the narrowness of expertise must take precedence over the girth and depth of the democratic crowd.
The COVID pandemic is not the first time that the American people have been let down and dragged down a dark road by their purportedly brilliant experts. Indeed, the defining event of the Baby Boom generation is, perhaps, the greatest (though hardly the only) example of previous “failures of the expert class.”
Americans’ faith in experts and the expert class likely hit its zenith in the 1950s, a decade in which almost anything seemed possible. America had defeated the Nazis and Imperial Japanese. It had rescued Europe from its war and the post-war destruction. It was strong and tough and, of course, it possessed the brightest scientists and the mightiest weapons in all of human history.
On his best-known solo album, The Nightfly, Steely Dan co-founder Donald Fagen reminisced about those days and the promise they held. For example, in “I.G.Y.,” he muses:
Standing tough under stars and stripes
A just machine to make big decisions
The I, the G, and the Y in the title of Fagen’s song refer to the “International Geophysical Year,” which was an 18-month-long scientific exchange celebration that ran from July 1957 to December 1958. The project was meant to take advantage of a reprieve in Cold War tensions to demonstrate to the world how science could produce lasting peace and harmony. The Soviets spoiled the peace and harmony bit by launching Sputnik three months later, sooner than the Americans could launch their satellite propelled by the rockets of Project Vanguard. In a fitting twist to the utopian agitprop of the IGY project, in response to Sputnik and to Vanguard’s failures, the United States turned, at last, to one of its greatest “experts” on rocket design, the erstwhile Nazi Wernher von Braun.
Of course, most Americans didn’t know about Braun, and so their illusions about the “experts” remained unshattered. In 1960, they elected a man and an administration that would come to epitomize the hope and the faith they placed in their experts. David Halberstam put it as follows in his classic The Best and the Brightest:
We seemed about to enter an Olympian age in this country, brains and intellect harnessed to great force, the better to define a common good… It seems long ago now, that excitement which swept through the country, or at least the intellectual reaches of it, that feeling that America was going to change, that the government had been handed down from the tired, flabby chamber-of-commerce mentality of the Eisenhower years to the best and brightest of a generation.
As the Fates and Nemesis would have it, however, it was the best and brightest who, in their arrogance and insularity, eventually shattered the expertise illusion with their debacle in Vietnam. Again, Halberstam wrote:
There is no small irony here: An administration which flaunted its intellectual superiority and its superior academic credentials made the most critical of decisions with virtually no input from anyone who had any expertise on the recent history of that part of the world, and it in no way factored in the entire experience of the French Indochina War. Part of the reason for this were the upheavals of the McCarthy period, but in part it was also the arrogance of men of the Atlantic; it was as if these men did not need to know about such a distant and somewhat less worthy part of the world. Lesser parts of the world attracted lesser men; years later I came upon a story which illustrated this theory perfectly. Jack Langguth, a writer and college classmate of mine, mentioned to a member of that Administration that he was thinking of going on to study Latin American history. The man had turned to him, his contempt barely concealed, and said, “Second-rate parts of the world for second-rate minds.”
The battle between the “rule of experts” and the rule of the people dates, like most of the dreadful battles in our society, to the dawn of the Progressive Era and the musings of Richard Ely and Woodrow Wilson. The expert class they envisioned proved to be a disaster, just as the Best and the Brightest did—and just as the health and education experts did during COVID.
As I say, the problem here isn’t expertise per se. Expertise is invaluable, obviously. Rather, the problem is the belief that expertise conveys both infallibility and moral superiority and, therefore, should—always and everywhere—be considered superior to the will of the people. Again, this is an artifact of Progressivism, and as important and insightful as books like David Zweig’s may be, they will not alter the dysfunctional operation of our system until we address this original sin.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Tesla To Offer &quot;Company Update&quot; With Tuesday&apos;s Earnings Report: What To Watch&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla has set its Q1 2025 earnings call for Tuesday, April 22, at 4:30 p.m. CT / 5:30 p.m. ET. As usual, the event will be livestreamed, with a recording available later on Tesla’s website. The Q1 Update Letter will be released after markets close that same day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quarter, as multiple Tesla blogs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-company-update-q1-earnings-call-date/&quot;&gt;Teslarati&lt;/a&gt; have pointed out, Tesla is also adding a new element: a “Company Update.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, the term appeared in both its vehicle delivery report and on the company’s official X account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In addition to posting first quarter results, Tesla management &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;will hold a live company update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and question and answer webcast that day,” the company stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation is growing that Tesla may use the update to reveal more about its upcoming projects, particularly the affordable EVs teased in its Q4 2024 report: “Plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025...”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings are expected to show a 4.4% decline in profit to $0.43 per share, with revenue holding steady at $21.45 billion, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyst estimates range from $0.30 to $0.51 per share, but consensus has dropped over 40% since late 2024. Piper Sandler warned the results will “likely underwhelm,” with margins “probably trending near multiyear lows.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/musk1234.jpg?itok=TXkSEBO_&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/musk1234.jpg?itok=TXkSEBO_&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;e0d0f020-2e7a-4551-9159-0fe8285a1822&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/musk1234.jpg?itok=TXkSEBO_&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s five things in particular investors will be looking for in this upcoming report and/or update, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-earnings-five-questions-that-need-answers-for-investors/&quot;&gt;IBD noted this weekend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investor focus is shifting to Tesla’s promised robotaxi rollout.&lt;/strong&gt; Musk has said paid rides would begin in Austin this June, but his past claims about autonomy have repeatedly fallen short. The latest FSD update shows modest progress, but it&apos;s still far from viable as a robotaxi platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cybercab—unveiled last year as a two-seater without a steering wheel—is supposed to launch before 2027 at under $30,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Reuters recently reported that Trump’s 145% tariff on Chinese goods has halted key parts shipments, possibly delaying both the Cybercab and Semi. The Cybercab’s cost-saving “unboxed” manufacturing method also remains unproven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla’s long-teased affordable EV. &lt;/strong&gt;Reports suggest the first lower-cost option may just be a simplified Model Y, possibly arriving in 2025 or 2026. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vehicle sales for Q1 fell 13% year-over-year to 336,681&lt;/strong&gt;. Growth is expected to stagnate this year, with consensus forecasting a modest 3% increase in deliveries, though some analysts now expect fewer sales than in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China sales rose slightly but remain low-margin, while U.S. and European demand has been hit by Musk’s controversial public profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;strong&gt;Tesla’s exposure to Trump’s tariffs&lt;/strong&gt; is limited compared to other automakers, it still relies on Chinese suppliers for battery components, including CATL and BYD. Investors will be watching for updates on how Tesla plans to respond to trade tensions and cost pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/musk123.jpg?itok=vEmqvhN5&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/musk123.jpg?itok=vEmqvhN5&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;e753a401-4e35-4c82-aab1-28eff517b538&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;370&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/musk123.jpg?itok=vEmqvhN5&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk’s political involvement&lt;/strong&gt; is also on watch. He has been rumored to be finishing his work with DOGE by May and people are watching for a potential full-time return to Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBD &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-earnings-five-questions-that-need-answers-for-investors/&quot;&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt; that a March YouGov/Yahoo News poll found 67% of U.S. adults wouldn’t consider a Tesla, with 37% citing Musk as the reason. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a longtime bull, cut his Tesla price target by 40%, calling the situation a “perfect storm” and estimating Tesla has lost at least 10% of its future customer base—potentially more than 20% in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demonstrations at dealerships and reports of vandalism continue. Musk is reportedly planning to leave his White House role, but no timeline has been confirmed. Investors will be listening for any update on his level of involvement moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The UK Is Doubling Down On Wind Energy</title>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;The UK Is Doubling Down On Wind Energy&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Wind-Power/The-UK-Is-Doubling-Down-on-Wind-Energy.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Felicity Bradstock via OilPrice.com,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UK is expanding its wind energy capacity, particularly offshore, with the approval of the Rampion 2 project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rampion 2 expansion will add 1.2 GW of capacity, enough to power around 1 million UK homes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UK government aims to quadruple its offshore wind capacity by 2030 as part of its net-zero carbon goals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K. is already a world leader in wind energy, having rapidly expanded both its onshore and offshore wind capacity over the last decade. Now, under the new Labour government, the U.K. hopes to expand its wind power sector even further through the massive expansion of the Rampion offshore wind farm. &lt;strong&gt;This is expected to help the government progress towards achieving its net-zero carbon ambitions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-18_dzaab0nuh1.jpg?itok=aQ4IUsWw&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-18_dzaab0nuh1.jpg?itok=aQ4IUsWw&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;8b5598e6-5987-43c9-9f07-c318fdf05420&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;209&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-18_dzaab0nuh1.jpg?itok=aQ4IUsWw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 2023, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.renewableuk.com/media/xyubzj4o/wind-energy-facts-and-figures-brochure-september-2024-final.pdf&quot;&gt;46.4 percent of the UK’s electricity was generated using renewable energy sources&lt;/a&gt;, of which wind energy contributed 61 percent. &lt;/strong&gt;Around 39.7 percent of the U.K.’s wind energy is generated onshore and the remaining 60.3 offshore. The U.K. constructed its first commercial onshore wind farm in 1991, generating 1 GW of wind capacity. In 2024, the U.K.’s wind energy capacity increased to 30GW, double that of 2017. The U.K. has 11,906 turbines, with 9,141 onshore and 2,765 offshore, consisting of 10 floating and 2,755 fixed turbines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approximately 32,000 people are employed in the U.K.’s offshore wind industry, a figure that is expected to increase to over 120,000 by 2030.&lt;/strong&gt; The government also hopes to achieve 60 GW of wind capacity by the end of the decade, which could add as much as $58.5 billion to the economy. By the beginning of 2025, the U.K. had grown its offshore wind energy capacity to become the largest in Europe and &lt;a href=&quot;https://maritime-executive.com/article/wind-energy-becomes-uk-s-largest-source-of-electricity-surpassing-gas#:~:text=The%20UK%27s%20offshore%20wind%20sector,growth%20in%20the%20following%20years.&quot;&gt;second only to China&lt;/a&gt;, at 14 GW. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In early April, the government approved plans to develop Rampion 2, an offshore wind farm with enough energy to power around 1 million U.K. homes. &lt;/strong&gt;The expansion of the Rampion offshore wind farm, off England’s south coast, would include the addition of 90 turbines to add 1.2 GW of capacity. The project is expected to create 4,000 jobs during the construction phase, which is scheduled to commence in 2026. The government decision on the expansion was expected to be delivered in February but it has been delayed while more information is collected from the project’s developer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind farm is being developed by RWE as the majority shareholder (50.1 percent), a Macquarie-led consortium (25 percent), and Enbridge (24.9 percent). The electricity produced at Rampion will be transported to land via subsea cables. An underground cable will then deliver the power inland to a new substation at Oakendene near Cowfold before connecting it to the national grid at Bolney in Sussex. &lt;strong&gt;The wind farm is expected to be operational by the late 2020s. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danielle Lane, the director of offshore wind development U.K. and Ireland at RWE, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.power-technology.com/news/uk-rampion-wind-farm-extension/?cf-view&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt;, “We are delighted to receive the development consent order for the proposed Rampion 2 offshore wind farm. This is a key milestone in the development of the project, as Rampion 2 can play an important role in helping secure the U.K.’s energy supplies from our abundant wind resource and play a key role in supporting the U.K. government’s clean power ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since coming into power last July, the Labour government has gone full throttle on the deployment of green energy, with plans to double the U.K.’s onshore wind, triple its solar power, and quadruple its offshore wind power capacity by 2030. It has also announced plans to reduce the contribution of natural gas to the country’s electricity generation to just 5 percent by the end of the decade. Thanks to the development of a more friendly investment environment, in an event in October some of the world’s largest green energy companies pledged to invest almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Labours-Leadership-Has-Sparked-Massive-Clean-Energy-Investments-in-the-UK.html&quot;&gt;$31.39 billion across the U.K&lt;/a&gt;., demonstrating that greater public investment in the sector is attracting higher levels of private financing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/04/offshore-windfarm-in-sussex-turbines-rampion&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The U.K. has a boundless supply of wind that cannot be turned on and off at the whims of dictators and petrostates. It’s time to get off the fossil fuel rollercoaster, roll out clean power, protect our energy security and bring down bills for good.” He added, “This project puts us within reach of our clean power offshore wind target,” Miliband said. “Through our plan for change, we’re getting on with delivering the clean energy and jobs Britain needs.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year was a record year for wind energy production, with onshore and offshore projects producing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e3g9xv3ylo&quot;&gt;83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, an increase from almost 79 TWh in 2023. In around 10 days in December alone, over 50 percent of Britain&apos;s electricity production came from wind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, there are also less windy periods, where energy production is lower. This suggests the need for greater investment in battery storage technology to make the renewable energy source more reliable and help reduce the U.K.’s reliance on fossil fuels during low-production times.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. is already a major onshore and offshore producer of wind energy, having developed several projects over the last three decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approval of the new Rampion 2 project is expected to put the country on track to achieve its end-of-decade climate goals, by decarbonising its transmission network. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is one of many clean energy projects the Labour government has announced over the last eight months, with the ambitious green transition agenda expected to attract high levels of private funding in the sector.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The UK is expanding its wind energy capacity, particularly offshore, with the approval of the Rampion 2 project.
The Rampion 2 expansion will add 1.2 GW of capacity, enough to power around 1 million UK homes.
The UK government aims to quadruple its offshore wind capacity by 2030 as part of its net-zero carbon goals.
The U.K. is already a world leader in wind energy, having rapidly expanded both its onshore and offshore wind capacity over the last decade. Now, under the new Labour government, the U.K. hopes to expand its wind power sector even further through the massive expansion of the Rampion offshore wind farm. This is expected to help the government progress towards achieving its net-zero carbon ambitions. 



In 2023, 46.4 percent of the UK’s electricity was generated using renewable energy sources, of which wind energy contributed 61 percent. Around 39.7 percent of the U.K.’s wind energy is generated onshore and the remaining 60.3 offshore. The U.K. constructed its first commercial onshore wind farm in 1991, generating 1 GW of wind capacity. In 2024, the U.K.’s wind energy capacity increased to 30GW, double that of 2017. The U.K. has 11,906 turbines, with 9,141 onshore and 2,765 offshore, consisting of 10 floating and 2,755 fixed turbines. 
Approximately 32,000 people are employed in the U.K.’s offshore wind industry, a figure that is expected to increase to over 120,000 by 2030. The government also hopes to achieve 60 GW of wind capacity by the end of the decade, which could add as much as $58.5 billion to the economy. By the beginning of 2025, the U.K. had grown its offshore wind energy capacity to become the largest in Europe and second only to China, at 14 GW. 
In early April, the government approved plans to develop Rampion 2, an offshore wind farm with enough energy to power around 1 million U.K. homes. The expansion of the Rampion offshore wind farm, off England’s south coast, would include the addition of 90 turbines to add 1.2 GW of capacity. The project is expected to create 4,000 jobs during the construction phase, which is scheduled to commence in 2026. The government decision on the expansion was expected to be delivered in February but it has been delayed while more information is collected from the project’s developer. 
The wind farm is being developed by RWE as the majority shareholder (50.1 percent), a Macquarie-led consortium (25 percent), and Enbridge (24.9 percent). The electricity produced at Rampion will be transported to land via subsea cables. An underground cable will then deliver the power inland to a new substation at Oakendene near Cowfold before connecting it to the national grid at Bolney in Sussex. The wind farm is expected to be operational by the late 2020s. 
Danielle Lane, the director of offshore wind development U.K. and Ireland at RWE, stated, “We are delighted to receive the development consent order for the proposed Rampion 2 offshore wind farm. This is a key milestone in the development of the project, as Rampion 2 can play an important role in helping secure the U.K.’s energy supplies from our abundant wind resource and play a key role in supporting the U.K. government’s clean power ambitions.”
Since coming into power last July, the Labour government has gone full throttle on the deployment of green energy, with plans to double the U.K.’s onshore wind, triple its solar power, and quadruple its offshore wind power capacity by 2030. It has also announced plans to reduce the contribution of natural gas to the country’s electricity generation to just 5 percent by the end of the decade. Thanks to the development of a more friendly investment environment, in an event in October some of the world’s largest green energy companies pledged to invest almost $31.39 billion across the U.K., demonstrating that greater public investment in the sector is attracting higher levels of private financing. 
U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said, “The U.K. has a boundless supply of wind that cannot be turned on and off at the whims of dictators and petrostates. It’s time to get off the fossil fuel rollercoaster, roll out clean power, protect our energy security and bring down bills for good.” He added, “This project puts us within reach of our clean power offshore wind target,” Miliband said. “Through our plan for change, we’re getting on with delivering the clean energy and jobs Britain needs.”
Last year was a record year for wind energy production, with onshore and offshore projects producing 83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across Great Britain, an increase from almost 79 TWh in 2023. In around 10 days in December alone, over 50 percent of Britain&apos;s electricity production came from wind. 
However, there are also less windy periods, where energy production is lower. This suggests the need for greater investment in battery storage technology to make the renewable energy source more reliable and help reduce the U.K.’s reliance on fossil fuels during low-production times.
The U.K. is already a major onshore and offshore producer of wind energy, having developed several projects over the last three decades. 
The approval of the new Rampion 2 project is expected to put the country on track to achieve its end-of-decade climate goals, by decarbonising its transmission network. 
This is one of many clean energy projects the Labour government has announced over the last eight months, with the ambitious green transition agenda expected to attract high levels of private funding in the sector.

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official economic data from any government is always treated with suspicion by anyone with common sense.  The US, for example, witnessed some of the most egregious statistical tinkering imaginable under the Biden Administration, not to mention outright lies and propaganda from the establishment media on the health of the economy.  To this day no one has been fired (or tarred and feathered) for hiding the reality of the stagflation crisis.  Any government or corporate economist that called the threat &quot;transitory&quot; should be stripped of their financial prestige and banished to a cash register at Arby&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let&apos;s not forget Biden&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/lost-todays-job-revision-chaos-over-1-million-foreign-born-workers-found-job-and-no&quot;&gt;misrepresentation of the labor market&lt;/a&gt;, portraying millions of new jobs for illegal migrants and visa holders as if they were jobs benefiting American citizens.  In the US and across the western world, lying about the economy is generally seen by politicians as a temporary solution to secure reelection.  However, in China, lying about the economy is treated as a national security imperative.  If there&apos;s anything in the world that gives communists a feeling of existential dread, it&apos;s the fear that their ideological enemies will discover proof that communism doesn&apos;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump Administration&apos;s tariffs on China are not the initiator of the nation&apos;s troubles, they are more a bookend to a process of decline that has been ongoing for years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/ChinaCollapse1.jpg?itok=lS6l1vUv&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ChinaCollapse1.jpg?itok=lS6l1vUv&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;e772fc85-54bc-46af-8e54-e69f5d50b72d&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ChinaCollapse1.jpg?itok=lS6l1vUv&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall tariffs on Chinese goods currently sit at 124%, but some goods will be taxed as high as 245%.  Trump has given a 1 month exemption on electronic parts and devices, perhaps to offer manufacturers like Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft time to arrange sourcing from alternative vendors.  The problem for Chinese manufacturers is not just the tariffs but the uncertainty of timing and sudden changes to policy.  They say no one is willing to make a big move on production or shipments until the trade landscape becomes more predictable.  This means most Chinese factories are frozen in stasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s tariff actions are widely criticized by the media as erratic or poorly planned, but what they don&apos;t understand is that uncertainty is the real leverage, not the tariffs.  What seems like a spur of the moment decision or a sudden capitulation on Trump&apos;s part can be highly effective at throwing foreign governments and corporations off balance.  Globalism requires a perpetual status quo, change of any kind is like holy water to a vampire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese shipments are on standby and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/16/trade-war-fallout-china-freight-ship-decline-begins-orders-plummet.html&quot;&gt;orders are frozen&lt;/a&gt;.  Nothing is moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQ9klecFbMw&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At bottom, China will not be able to survive tariffs on the current scale for long (a single year of 124% tariffs would crush China&apos;s economy beyond repair).  The US is 15% of China&apos;s export market, which may not sound substantial but their next largest trading partner (outside of Hong Kong) is Vietnam at 4% of exports.  In terms of domestic buying, China is 11% of the global consumer market which is not too shabby, but compared to the US with its 30%-35% global consumer market share there is no chance that the Chinese will be able to fill the void domestically and stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the situation is far worse than most people know...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been suffering from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-deflation-housing-congress-36d116f4657aa3064882af9b2dd57b14&quot;&gt;deflationary crisis since 2023&lt;/a&gt;.  An uptick in exports during the pandemic was offset by the CCP&apos;s draconian lockdowns.  This was, essentially, fiscal suicide on the part of the government and China has been struggling ever since.  Their property market has imploded, partially due to overbuilding through government subsidized infrastructure programs that flooded the market with poorly constructed homes and buildings that were then left to rot.  Corporate defaults have run rampant and left investors with nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some optimism that the government’s measures to end the crisis had been working to reinvigorate the market, but on Mar 31st, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/why-china-cant-sort-out-its-property-market-mess&quot;&gt;government-linked developer Vanke&lt;/a&gt; reported a record 49.5 billion yuan (S$9.1 billion) annual loss for 2024.  It’s the company’s first full-year loss since its initial public offering in 1991, reigniting concerns about the sector and showing just how deep the problem runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gVtO4FIb3vw&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these projects do finally see some progress it is often due to dangerously poor construction standards and subpar workmanship; what many now refer to as &quot;Tofu Dreg&quot; buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWOBYGC9JJI?start=26&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deflationary spiral has been eating away at employment and has also resulted in numerous factories refusing to pay their workers on time (or at all).  Unpaid wages are leading to frequent protests and a disturbing trend of factory fires.  The government is limited in how it can respond to the problem.  Stimulus is an option, but China&apos;s &lt;span data-huuid=&quot;16814439806895594041&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;overall non-financial debt is well over 300% of GDP already.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&apos;s attempts to hide the decay from the outside world are becoming less and less effective.  With Chinese citizens able to access the internet beyond the &quot;Great Firewall&quot;, more and more videos are being leaked by people within the country who are tired of the misinformation.  Again, the CCP views negative economic data as a national security threat and any citizen caught leaking this info could be subject to harsh punishment.  Chinese citizens have taken substantial risks to get the truth out there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It cannot be stressed enough that the global economy is largely a farce, but China is closest to the edge of the cliff in terms of consequences and crisis.  The interdependency of globalism has left many nations without the ability to weather a trade dispute and China&apos;s survival is almost entirely based on steady exports to the west and the US in particular. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t let high paid TikTok and YouTube influencers fool you with videos of Chinese skyscrapers caked with LED lights or lavish parties with dancing robots.  This is not the true China.  Underneath the facade is a nation on the brink of disaster.   &lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Minerals In Hand, Africa&apos;s Trade Envoys Head For The US&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/minerals-in-hand-africas-trade-envoys-head-for-the-us-5844114?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Darren Taylor via The Epoch Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mcebisi Jonas doesn’t usually suffer from nerves. If he did, he wouldn’t have survived a brutal guerrilla campaign against South Africa’s apartheid foot-soldiers in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As a cadre for the ANC [then-banned African National Congress], I was fighting for freedom from racism, for black people’s right to vote, for human rights,” &lt;/strong&gt;he told The Epoch Times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Now, I am about to fight another, very different battle. I am a bit nervous, but I am ready to talk with any and all representatives of the U.S. president, and I trust we will treat one another with respect,”&lt;/strong&gt; said Pretoria’s eloquent former minister of finance and now successful businessman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonas is part of a recently created exclusive club of special envoys appointed by most of Africa’s 54 countries to negotiate better export terms they hope will allow them to sell their goods for “reasonable profit” in the world’s most lucrative market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2890%29_5.jpg?itok=c5nEg-Mk&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2890%29_5.jpg?itok=c5nEg-Mk&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;0ff1bf45-cd19-42a8-9584-06382eac8d2f&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2890%29_5.jpg?itok=c5nEg-Mk&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s April 2 announcement of tariffs on goods exported to the United States by its economic partners. Trump has said the duties would correct trade imbalances he said are unfair to America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week later, Trump paused his reciprocal tariffs for 90 days—except for those on China—indicating that many countries had reached out and that the United States was open to negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If nothing were to change after the 90-day pause, some of the highest tariffs—between 30 and 50 percent—would be for products imported from Africa.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa’s envoys are now rushing to meet the deadline in July when the raised duties are scheduled to come into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2891%29_5.jpg?itok=9WTmjdvf&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2891%29_5.jpg?itok=9WTmjdvf&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;89c44cc2-10d3-46c9-9de4-78e330aec285&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2891%29_5.jpg?itok=9WTmjdvf&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A man melts pure gold fragments coming from different mines in the region, at a gold market in Geita, Tanzania, on May 28, 2022. Luis Tato/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Most African countries export much more to the United States than they import from the United States, so the Trump administration calculated that trade between the regions is unfairly weighted towards Africa and that the United States is losing out,”&lt;/em&gt; explained Morné Malan, deputy head of policy at South Africa’s Free Market Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Besides trade deficits, Trump also looked for other signs of trade barriers as criteria for imposing tariffs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya, with which the United States enjoyed a trade surplus, is an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the United States Trade Representative, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/africa/east-africa/kenya&quot;&gt;East Africa’s largest economy&lt;/a&gt; exported goods—mainly textiles, coffee, tea, and fruit—to the value of $737.3 million to the United States in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That year, Kenya imported goods worth $782.5 million from the United States, primarily petroleum products, aircraft and related parts, machinery, and pharmaceuticals, giving the United States a trade surplus of $45.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, President William Ruto’s government had anticipated that Trump would hit Kenya with a higher tariff, as Nairobi charges a 10 percent tax on American imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, said Trade and Industry cabinet secretary, Lee Kinyanjui, the country went into “damage control mode,” dispatching a team of negotiators to the White House a day before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Kenyan government’s main objective of securing duty-free or “very favourable duty access” for its goods into the U.S. market is still the subject of talks, Trump levied a reciprocal tariff of only 10 percent on Nairobi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We believe it helped us a lot to speak to Trump’s people ahead of his announcement, and directly afterwards,” Kinyanjui told The Epoch Times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We are considering a free trade agreement with the United States, and that will mean the scrapping of the tariff on American goods entering Kenya, and we will hopefully still export duty-free to the United States. That is reciprocity.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Gruzd of the South African Institute of International Affairs described Kenya as a “bit of an anomaly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am no fan of the African governments that steal their countries’ resources and keep their people poor, but I must also agree that it’s a bit of a stretch to expect nations with low GDPs and tiny budgets and huge debts and low manufacturing bases to import at large scale expensive goods, products and services from the wealthiest economy in the world,” he told The Epoch Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in this context that the African envoys will visit the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“He’s about to enter a lion’s den,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Malan said of Jonas, the South African diplomat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ 31 percent tariffs on South Africa—which was included in a list of 60 nations Trump said had traded with his country unfairly during his announcement on April 2—is just the president’s latest salvo against the continent’s largest, most industrialized economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country featured prominently in the series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025&quot;&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt; Trump has signed since re-entering the White House on Jan. 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of his first executive orders, the U.S. leader accused Pretoria of implementing racist laws aimed at discriminating and encouraging violence against white Afrikaners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump subsequently withdrew $440 million in annual funding to South Africa, resulting in a slowdown of the country’s HIV treatment and prevention program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He said South Africa is a threat to U.S. national security as its ANC government has military and economic alliances with some of Washington’s primary geopolitical foes, including China, Iran, and Russia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump also criticized Pretoria for launching a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/South-Africa-v-Israel.pdf&quot;&gt;case of genocide&lt;/a&gt; in the Gaza war against Israel at the International Court of Justice. The war was triggered by terrorist group Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, Secretary of State Marco Rubio expelled South Africa’s ambassador to Washington, the ANC’s Ebrahim Rasool, after the diplomat described Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement and his administration as “supremacist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonas grimaced and said, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Yes, recent history between South Africa and the United States is not good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But I am convinced we can cooperate going forward and we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement that will foster the flow of American goods into our country, and vice versa.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Gruzd of the South African Institute of International Affairs said that, in communications within the Trump administration, “it has become clear that they consider Pretoria to be the enemy, giving the [President Cyril] Ramaphosa government the same status as Beijing and Moscow and Tehran.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many in Africa, said Gruzd, Pretoria has “good cards to deal” to convince the U.S. president. Its cards are beaming the allure of the continent’s vast resources, which include precious metals like gold and platinum, and critical minerals essential to energy security and defense, as they’re major components of weapons and military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a paper analyzing Africa’s potential responses to the U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-should-africa-respond-trumps-new-tariffs&quot;&gt;tariffs&lt;/a&gt;, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington said 24 of Africa’s 54 countries are dependent on mining and minerals for income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Africa holds a third of the world’s critical minerals&lt;/strong&gt;, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/what-african-producers-of-critical-minerals-can-learn-from-indonesias-experience/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by U.S. think-tank The Atlantic Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa already supplies almost all of America’s chromium and provides a quarter of its manganese requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/manganese-statistics-and-information&quot;&gt;Manganese&lt;/a&gt; is a diverse mineral, used to produce steel and rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chromium features prominently in weapons manufacturing, including missile systems and fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other minerals produced at a large scale by African countries include lithium, used in electric car batteries, and coltan, used in communications equipment like cell phones and computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Trump has exempted critical minerals from tariffs, Gruzd said South Africa’s mineral wealth still has a role in possibly lowering the U.S. levies on South Africa, considering the Trump administration’s wish to reduce U.S. dependency on Chinese supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“China dominates Africa’s minerals sector, and it has mines all over the place, from DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo] to Zambia to Guinea,”&lt;/strong&gt; Gruzd said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beijing’s harvesting of the continent’s minerals and metals and processing them has placed the United States at an immense disadvantage in terms of making sure it has a reliable supply of these critical items well into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gruzd said if the United States and South Africa can strike a deal on critical minerals, “that would be a big win, politically and economically, for the Trump administration.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If Trump is offered mining rights in certain African countries, this would go a long way in persuading him to lower tariffs and perhaps even drop them because it would give the United States a big foothold in global supply chains,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS said that Trump should revoke tariffs on African countries and that the African Union and African leaders “should seek to demonstrate that preferential trade with the continent, in fact, overall serves U.S. national interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just like Canada and Mexico were exempt from the reciprocal tariffs due to the United States’ national interest, a similar case can be made for Africa in terms of market access and critical minerals supply chain security,” wrote economic development experts Hannah Ryder, Trevor Lwere, and Ovigwe Eguegu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As tariffs are set to hit U.S. firms in the automotive, aerospace, and chemical sectors, which are heavily dependent on critical minerals, the bulk of which Africa has, it is not in the U.S. interest to impose tariffs on African goods.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryder, Lwere, and Eguegu highlighted that one of the Trump administration’s aims is to gain greater market access for American firms and products abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This requires the existence of purchasing power amongst foreign consumers. By imposing tariffs on African exports to the United States, however, the United States makes it difficult for Africa to obtain the purchasing power necessary to demand U.S. products,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The experts said the United States should support preferential access for African goods to the American market as a market-building strategy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is critical, they wrote, especially considering that Africa has the youngest population and will be home to over 25 percent of the global population in the next few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bamidele Ayemibo, lead trade policy consultant at Nigeria’s 3T Impex Consulting Limited, said African governments’ response to Trump’s tariffs should be to sign preferential trade agreements with the United States—and with other partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The last thing they should do is retaliate with higher tariffs on U.S. products; they do not have the economic power to do so and they will only hurt themselves,” he told The Epoch Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Now, more than ever, it is time for talk and for bargaining.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Minerals In Hand, Africa&apos;s Trade Envoys Head For The US

            
Authored by Darren Taylor via The Epoch Times,
Mcebisi Jonas doesn’t usually suffer from nerves. If he did, he wouldn’t have survived a brutal guerrilla campaign against South Africa’s apartheid foot-soldiers in the 1970s and 1980s.
“As a cadre for the ANC [then-banned African National Congress], I was fighting for freedom from racism, for black people’s right to vote, for human rights,” he told The Epoch Times.
“Now, I am about to fight another, very different battle. I am a bit nervous, but I am ready to talk with any and all representatives of the U.S. president, and I trust we will treat one another with respect,” said Pretoria’s eloquent former minister of finance and now successful businessman.
Jonas is part of a recently created exclusive club of special envoys appointed by most of Africa’s 54 countries to negotiate better export terms they hope will allow them to sell their goods for “reasonable profit” in the world’s most lucrative market.



This followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s April 2 announcement of tariffs on goods exported to the United States by its economic partners. Trump has said the duties would correct trade imbalances he said are unfair to America.
A week later, Trump paused his reciprocal tariffs for 90 days—except for those on China—indicating that many countries had reached out and that the United States was open to negotiations.
If nothing were to change after the 90-day pause, some of the highest tariffs—between 30 and 50 percent—would be for products imported from Africa.
Africa’s envoys are now rushing to meet the deadline in July when the raised duties are scheduled to come into effect.

“Most African countries export much more to the United States than they import from the United States, so the Trump administration calculated that trade between the regions is unfairly weighted towards Africa and that the United States is losing out,” explained Morné Malan, deputy head of policy at South Africa’s Free Market Foundation.
Besides trade deficits, Trump also looked for other signs of trade barriers as criteria for imposing tariffs.
Kenya, with which the United States enjoyed a trade surplus, is an example.
According to the United States Trade Representative, East Africa’s largest economy exported goods—mainly textiles, coffee, tea, and fruit—to the value of $737.3 million to the United States in 2024.
That year, Kenya imported goods worth $782.5 million from the United States, primarily petroleum products, aircraft and related parts, machinery, and pharmaceuticals, giving the United States a trade surplus of $45.2 million.
Despite this, President William Ruto’s government had anticipated that Trump would hit Kenya with a higher tariff, as Nairobi charges a 10 percent tax on American imports.
So, said Trade and Industry cabinet secretary, Lee Kinyanjui, the country went into “damage control mode,” dispatching a team of negotiators to the White House a day before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement.
Although the Kenyan government’s main objective of securing duty-free or “very favourable duty access” for its goods into the U.S. market is still the subject of talks, Trump levied a reciprocal tariff of only 10 percent on Nairobi.
“We believe it helped us a lot to speak to Trump’s people ahead of his announcement, and directly afterwards,” Kinyanjui told The Epoch Times.
“We are considering a free trade agreement with the United States, and that will mean the scrapping of the tariff on American goods entering Kenya, and we will hopefully still export duty-free to the United States. That is reciprocity.”
Steven Gruzd of the South African Institute of International Affairs described Kenya as a “bit of an anomaly.”
“I am no fan of the African governments that steal their countries’ resources and keep their people poor, but I must also agree that it’s a bit of a stretch to expect nations with low GDPs and tiny budgets and huge debts and low manufacturing bases to import at large scale expensive goods, products and services from the wealthiest economy in the world,” he told The Epoch Times.
It is in this context that the African envoys will visit the White House.
“He’s about to enter a lion’s den,” Malan said of Jonas, the South African diplomat.

      <title>Defund The Cartels: A Smarter Plan For The Border</title>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Defund The Cartels: A Smarter Plan For The Border&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/opinion/defund-the-cartels-a-smarter-plan-for-the-border-5844017?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Mollie Engelhart via The Epoch Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t fit neatly into a political box, especially when it comes to immigration. I’m a wife to a man who came here illegally at 16. I’ve taken legal guardianship of an unaccompanied minor and folded him into my family. I work in both hospitality and agriculture—industries that rely heavily on immigrant labor. My views on the border don’t align with any party line, and I’m aware that people on both sides of the aisle might find something in this article to disagree with. But that doesn’t make the conversation less necessary. It makes it more urgent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;America needs labor. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s not up for debate. We’ve raised a few generations of kids who are not equipped for hard, uncomfortable work—especially those who came of age during the pandemic. I’ve had over 350 employees at any one time in my businesses, and I’ve watched the workforce shift dramatically in just 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2889%29_5.jpg?itok=1gmAsNsb&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2889%29_5.jpg?itok=1gmAsNsb&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ca1514a5-86d5-4ea5-b2a9-a0ca8f381f88&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2889%29_5.jpg?itok=1gmAsNsb&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the same time, I believe a border wall is not racist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wall, like a fence or a locked front door, doesn’t carry moral weight. Strong borders make good neighbors. But let’s be honest: the southern border is already secured—just not by us. It’s secured by the Mexican cartels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every person crossing is paying $10,000 to $13,000 to make that journey—not including the pre-planned robbery that happens to nearly every person along the way, and sometimes additional financial extortion afterward. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not just turning a blind eye to this—we’re funding it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our labor shortage—our need for labor—is creating a massive revenue source for the cartels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many commentators scream, “Come legally!”—but the reality is, there are almost no viable legal pathways for Mexicans to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlike people from other countries, Mexicans cannot easily claim asylum. &lt;/strong&gt;Citizens of many Central and South American nations can claim asylum and stay in the United States while they await trial—a process that often takes five to 10 years. Even if their claim is denied, most never leave. Mexicans do not have this option. We are effectively prioritizing other nations over our immediate neighbor, and it makes no sense. We should be prioritizing Mexico first, and then Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humanitarian crisis is not what the media portrays. &lt;strong&gt;The real crisis is what happens before these people arrive - the women and children abused, trafficked, and disappeared in cartel territory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the man who hasn’t seen his mother in 20 years, or the woman who has children on both sides of the border and cannot return to see her children or grandchildren. She may never see her children here again. These are real stories. I live with them in my family and in my community. My husband didn’t see his mother for 12 years prior to marrying me and becoming an American citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, America is a melting pot. Yes, we welcome the tired and the poor. But no, we cannot take everyone. It’s not sustainable. And pretending otherwise only perpetuates suffering.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s create a 10-year low-skill work visa. It would cost $10,000 - money that currently goes to cartels. Workers would be permitted to come and go, visit family, and live with dignity. Employment would be mandatory; workers could not remain unemployed longer than three months. Applicants must have no criminal history. This visa would never lead to citizenship, even through marriage. The best case would be a green card, but not a vote. Workers would pay taxes and contribute $10 per paycheck to Social Security, which they would never draw from. After 10 years, the visa could be renewed once—or the worker could return home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We would prioritize Mexico, and then Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras—because a strong neighbor is national security. If your neighbor’s house is burning down, your own home is at risk.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong, thriving Mexico makes for a safer America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A healthy economy and stable society in the countries closest to us reduces pressure on our border and increases mutual prosperity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plan would dismantle the cartels’ business model, reunite families, end the incentive to bring children as props for border entry, and redirect billions of dollars from crime syndicates to the U.S. government. Migrants could fly directly into cities where jobs await—no more treacherous desert crossings or predatory smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One side of the aisle screams that we don’t want them—but still enjoys the literal fruits of their labor. The other side screams “humanitarian crisis” and “racism”—but takes no meaningful action, even when in power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, I believe there’s a solution that supports integrity for our border, for our businesses, for our families, and for our neighbors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But both sides of the aisle have not been interested in real solutions for a long time—and that begs the question: why? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the benefit of the gray? What is the benefit of a system that is clearly broken and leads to drugs, rape, murder, and chaos?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Defund The Cartels: A Smarter Plan For The Border

            
Authored by Mollie Engelhart via The Epoch Times,
I don’t fit neatly into a political box, especially when it comes to immigration. I’m a wife to a man who came here illegally at 16. I’ve taken legal guardianship of an unaccompanied minor and folded him into my family. I work in both hospitality and agriculture—industries that rely heavily on immigrant labor. My views on the border don’t align with any party line, and I’m aware that people on both sides of the aisle might find something in this article to disagree with. But that doesn’t make the conversation less necessary. It makes it more urgent.
America needs labor. That’s not up for debate. We’ve raised a few generations of kids who are not equipped for hard, uncomfortable work—especially those who came of age during the pandemic. I’ve had over 350 employees at any one time in my businesses, and I’ve watched the workforce shift dramatically in just 10 years.



At the same time, I believe a border wall is not racist.
A wall, like a fence or a locked front door, doesn’t carry moral weight. Strong borders make good neighbors. But let’s be honest: the southern border is already secured—just not by us. It’s secured by the Mexican cartels. 
Every person crossing is paying $10,000 to $13,000 to make that journey—not including the pre-planned robbery that happens to nearly every person along the way, and sometimes additional financial extortion afterward. 
We’re not just turning a blind eye to this—we’re funding it. 
Our labor shortage—our need for labor—is creating a massive revenue source for the cartels.
Many commentators scream, “Come legally!”—but the reality is, there are almost no viable legal pathways for Mexicans to do so.
Unlike people from other countries, Mexicans cannot easily claim asylum. Citizens of many Central and South American nations can claim asylum and stay in the United States while they await trial—a process that often takes five to 10 years. Even if their claim is denied, most never leave. Mexicans do not have this option. We are effectively prioritizing other nations over our immediate neighbor, and it makes no sense. We should be prioritizing Mexico first, and then Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.
The humanitarian crisis is not what the media portrays. The real crisis is what happens before these people arrive - the women and children abused, trafficked, and disappeared in cartel territory.
It’s the man who hasn’t seen his mother in 20 years, or the woman who has children on both sides of the border and cannot return to see her children or grandchildren. She may never see her children here again. These are real stories. I live with them in my family and in my community. My husband didn’t see his mother for 12 years prior to marrying me and becoming an American citizen.
Yes, America is a melting pot. Yes, we welcome the tired and the poor. But no, we cannot take everyone. It’s not sustainable. And pretending otherwise only perpetuates suffering.
Let’s create a 10-year low-skill work visa. It would cost $10,000 - money that currently goes to cartels. Workers would be permitted to come and go, visit family, and live with dignity. Employment would be mandatory; workers could not remain unemployed longer than three months. Applicants must have no criminal history. This visa would never lead to citizenship, even through marriage. The best case would be a green card, but not a vote. Workers would pay taxes and contribute $10 per paycheck to Social Security, which they would never draw from. After 10 years, the visa could be renewed once—or the worker could return home.
We would prioritize Mexico, and then Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras—because a strong neighbor is national security. If your neighbor’s house is burning down, your own home is at risk. 
A strong, thriving Mexico makes for a safer America. 
A healthy economy and stable society in the countries closest to us reduces pressure on our border and increases mutual prosperity.
This plan would dismantle the cartels’ business model, reunite families, end the incentive to bring children as props for border entry, and redirect billions of dollars from crime syndicates to the U.S. government. Migrants could fly directly into cities where jobs await—no more treacherous desert crossings or predatory smugglers.
One side of the aisle screams that we don’t want them—but still enjoys the literal fruits of their labor. The other side screams “humanitarian crisis” and “racism”—but takes no meaningful action, even when in power.
In closing, I believe there’s a solution that supports integrity for our border, for our businesses, for our families, and for our neighbors. 
But both sides of the aisle have not been interested in real solutions for a long time—and that begs the question: why? 
What is the benefit of the gray? What is the benefit of a system that is clearly broken and leads to drugs, rape, murder, and chaos?
