      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Why More People Are Testing Their Blood Without A Doctor&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/why-more-people-are-testing-their-blood-without-a-doctor-5834300?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&amp;src_src=partner&amp;src_cmp=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;Authored by Sheramy Tsai via The Epoch Times&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis ours),&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale doesn’t lie—but it doesn’t tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might be eating better, exercising more, and still seeing the same number each morning. It’s frustrating, discouraging, and, as it turns out, possibly misleading.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, weight has been treated as a primary marker of health. But a number on the scale says little about inflammation, cardiovascular risk, or metabolic dysfunction—factors that often shift before any visible weight loss appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s why more people are turning to at-home biomarker testing&lt;/strong&gt;—health tracking that looks beneath the surface, revealing internal changes long before they’re visible in the mirror or on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/SiPhox_MainImage.png?itok=fSLDty7a&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/SiPhox_MainImage.png?itok=fSLDty7a&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;576f1140-47f8-4972-9840-2ff90ac1e196&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/SiPhox_MainImage.png?itok=fSLDty7a&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colin Godby, an engineer and father of two, tested his blood out of curiosity, not concern. What he found was unexpected—and alarming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The at-home test revealed that Godby had hereditary hemochromatosis, a genetic condition that causes iron to accumulate in the body. Left untreated, it can lead to liver disease, heart problems, and other complications. It was a diagnosis standard labs hadn’t caught—and likely wouldn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’d been chalking up fatigue and joint pain to getting older,” he said. “But this gave me answers. Real ones.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What stood out to Godby wasn’t just the result—it was the realization that he might never have discovered the issue through routine care. He hadn’t planned to see a doctor, and even if he had, a ferritin test likely wouldn’t have been part of a standard workup.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I realized how blind I was to the nuance of my health,” said Godby. “And how likely it would be for many other people to also have potential issues they might not know about.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;From COVID-19 Swabs to Full Panels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, millions swabbed their noses at home and waited for COVID-19 test results—an experience that introduced many to the idea of testing health at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;COVID normalized the idea that you could test yourself and act on the results&lt;/strong&gt;,” said Jordan Moradian, a product and growth manager at SiPhox Health, a direct-to-consumer testing company, in an interview with The Epoch Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the pandemic, health tracking was gaining traction among wellness enthusiasts. COVID-19 accelerated the trend, Moradian said, fueled by renewed interest in immunity, more time at home, and popular science voices like Andrew Huberman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grab a SiPhox blood test kit &lt;a href=&quot;https://siphox.zhstore.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;https://siphox.zhstore.com/&quot; data-image-href=&quot;https://siphox.zhstore.com/&quot; data-link-option=&quot;2&quot; href=&quot;https://siphox.zhstore.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;031ad96b-2717-4ef4-bef2-c0f7b49b563e&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;141&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/SiPhox_0.png?itok=X9iBcJqg&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Order SiPhox blood tests over our secure portal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, companies like SiPhox, Everlywell, LetsGetChecked, and QuestHealth offer clinical-grade diagnostics at home. Tests typically use finger-prick or saliva samples to measure everything from blood sugar and inflammation to hormones and cholesterol—and deliver results in days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The global home testing market, valued at more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/home-care-testing-market-report&quot;&gt;$10.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2024, is projected to nearly double by 2030&lt;/strong&gt;, according to Grand View Research. The growth reflects a shift toward preventive, patient-led care—emphasizing early detection, frequent monitoring, and personal agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the Doctor’s Office&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At-home blood testing gives people more control over their health, often filling gaps left by conventional care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most annual checkups include only basic labs—typically a lipid panel and perhaps a comprehensive metabolic panel. However, these often exclude markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, hormone balance, or cardiovascular risk. As a result, early signs of chronic disease may go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Many people turn to at-home biomarker tracking to test markers their physicians may not typically order,&lt;/strong&gt;” Moradian said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In places where diagnostics are limited, these tools offer a fuller health picture before a clinical visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appeal is not just access, but speed. Instead of waiting months for a follow-up panel, users can adjust their lifestyle and retest within weeks, getting near real-time feedback on what’s working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moradian identified three groups driving demand: people recovering from health scares who want early warnings; younger, data-driven users testing diets or supplements; and those in “medical deserts” with limited access to care.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most revealing data come from what routine checkups miss, he said. Many users discover elevated ApoB—a key heart disease marker—even with normal cholesterol. Others uncover hormonal imbalances, such as low testosterone, rarely screened for in standard exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, this internal data becomes more than diagnostic—it becomes personal. The numbers link daily choices to real biological change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Motivation in the Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bathroom scale is slow to move and quick to frustrate. Blood work, by contrast, offers internal proof that change is happening&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;even before it’s visible. A drop in blood sugar, a dip in inflammation, or a hormone shift can be more motivating than what’s seen in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Improvements in biomarkers almost always come before visible weight changes,” said Dr. Robert Lufkin, a physician and author of “Lies I Taught in Medical School,” in an email interview with The Epoch Times. “Tracking blood sugar or inflammation offers real-time feedback—often before any physical changes show up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moradian sees the same pattern. “Biomarker tracking offers a holistic view of one’s health,” he said. “When someone pursues weight loss, they can also see parallel improvements in blood pressure or kidney function—changes that would otherwise go unnoticed if they focused solely on the scale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;This ‘whole-picture’ perspective is hugely motivating&lt;/strong&gt;,” he added. “&lt;strong&gt;Seeing multiple indicators trend positively reinforces that lifestyle changes are working even before outward, easily visible progress appears&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a culture obsessed with appearance, internal markers offer a deeper kind of progress:&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;one rooted in biology, not vanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How Accurate Are At-Home Tests?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As at-home blood testing grows, many wonder if the results are as reliable as those from a doctor’s office. Companies like SiPhox say yes—if the right standards are met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;A common misconception is that at-home testing isn’t as accurate or reliable as clinical testing,&lt;/strong&gt;” Moradian said. “In reality, &lt;strong&gt;reputable at-home tests employ rigorously validated methodologies and must meet strict regulatory standards.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SiPhox processes tests through Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists-accredited labs, which are federally certified for accuracy and oversight. &lt;/strong&gt;The company reports a 95 percent to 99 percent match with standard venous draws, benchmarked quarterly against labs like LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not all tests meet these standards. Experts urge consumers to look past marketing and ask key questions: Is the lab certified? Are the tests validated? Do clinicians review results?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Association for Diagnostics &amp; Laboratory Medicine (ADLM) &lt;a href=&quot;https://myadlm.org/advocacy-and-outreach/position-statements/2024/direct-to-consumer-laboratory-testing&quot;&gt;supports&lt;/a&gt; at-home testing only through certified labs that provide clear explanations and follow-up options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Consumer-directed laboratory testing can provide valuable information,” said Anthony Killeen, the group’s president, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/adlm-supports-use-of-direct-to-consumer-tests-from-reputable-labs-with-appropriate-guidance-302293185.html&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. However, he emphasized that it must be used appropriately and with support from qualified professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADLM has also warned about quality gaps, calling for tighter regulation of misleading or poorly validated tests. As the industry grows, the group’s message is clear: Convenience must not come at the cost of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Limits of At-Home Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At-home blood testing offers fast, easy access to health data and the promise of early detection. However, experts warn that more data doesn’t always lead to better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One risk is over-testing. Like daily weigh-ins, frequent checks of glucose or inflammation can fuel anxiety over normal fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Frequent testing without proper context can lead to anxiety, overanalysis, and obsession with small, normal fluctuations,&lt;/strong&gt;” said Lufkin. “Not every spike or dip is meaningful—bodies are dynamic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is interpretation. Without a doctor’s guidance, users may make diet or supplement decisions based on a single number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Self-monitoring is intended to complement professional medical advice, not replace it,” said Moradian. “We encourage users to share their biomarker data with their health care providers, fostering collaborative decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://meridian.allenpress.com/aplm/article/144/10/1193/444916/Benefits-and-Risks-of-Direct-to-Consumer-Testing&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine echoed this concern, noting that consumers “may not know the risks or what significance a result has.” In some cases, false positives led to unnecessary procedures, added costs, and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy is another issue. A 2023 &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2809595&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that fewer than half of direct-to-consumer companies followed HIPAA guidelines. Only four allowed users to delete their data, while over half admitted they could share it for research or with third parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost is another barrier. While tests may appear cheaper than lab visits, a full panel can cost $75 to $300, and few are covered by insurance. For frequent users, the price adds up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Your Body, Your Baseline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At-home testing shifts the focus from population averages to personal baselines—moving health tracking from what works for most to what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea underpins “N=1 medicine,” a growing movement in which individuals act as their own experiments. Instead of relying on annual checkups or generic advice, users collect data, track trends, and make changes based on what works for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where to begin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lufkin recommends starting with a foundational lab panel that includes fasting insulin, fasting glucose, HbA1c (a longer-term marker of blood glucose levels), triglycerides and HDL (to calculate the ratio), CRP (a marker of inflammation), LDL-C, and vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These give a snapshot of your metabolic and inflammatory status—far more informative than weight or BMI,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once you have your baseline, Lufkin advises a gradual, focused approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick one change, such as cutting added sugar, walking after meals, or improving sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Track how you feel—energy, mood, cravings, and digestion often shift before lab numbers do.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Retest every three to six months to monitor trends and confirm your direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even small improvements confirm that your efforts are working—long before the mirror shows it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, at-home testing isn’t about micromanaging every fluctuation. “You don’t need to be perfect—just curious,” Lufkin said. “Let data guide your next best step. That’s real empowerment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And again, pick up a SiPhox test &lt;a href=&quot;https://siphox.zhstore.com/&quot;&gt;here...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Why More People Are Testing Their Blood Without A Doctor

            
Authored by Sheramy Tsai via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
The scale doesn’t lie—but it doesn’t tell the whole story.
You might be eating better, exercising more, and still seeing the same number each morning. It’s frustrating, discouraging, and, as it turns out, possibly misleading.

&lt;p&gt;Here are the conversations Kate McShane, Mark Jordan, and other analysts had with IR and management teams from retailers: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Buy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tariff exposure and impacts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Given President Trump&apos;s recent exclusion of electronics from tariffs, management noted that their exposure is likely even lower than the 20% remaining China tariff. BBY is still trying to figure out their tariff situation by talking to vendors, but noted that most of their COGS that originate from Mexico are under exclusion as well (leaving them at low exposure for Mexico). Management also emphasized that the tariff exposure to comp headwind correlation is not linear, as vendors have multiple sites of manufacturing and it is largely dependent on the trade offs vendors make. When comparing tariffs to 2018/2019, they noted that last time, tariffs came through on large appliances, and most of the product categories did not get hit much since they were also exempted. At the moment, management does not believe they have taken prices up (they anticipate tariffs impacting 2Q-4Q), and as of last earnings call, have not brought in any inventory early for tariffs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Navigating consumer elasticity and macroenvironment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Management stated that their guidance takes into account their potential estimate for consumer elasticity, as they accounted for factors such as product levels, vendor price increases, potential declines in purchased units, etc. They are also involved in weekly planning given the macro-environment, and are preparing themselves and their vendors to be ready in case of any quick tariff changes. In the case of a recession, management noted that there are still many levers they could move to preserve profitability, such as changing labor demand and reducing various SG&amp;A expenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BJ&apos;s Wholesale Club&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BJ could benefit as a limited SKU retailer when it comes to tariffs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; General merchandise comprises less than 15% of BJ&apos;s overall business. Management explained that BJ&apos;s limited SKU count and reliance on a treasure hunt experience gives the company more flexibility than some others. For example, BJ could forgo certain SKUs and offset that with other SKUs, making calculated choices depending on the situation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BJ expects to see SG&amp;A deleverage this year but automation helps offset&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. On the 4Q earnings call, BJ guided to SG&amp;A deleverage, driven by an acceleration in new club openings, particularly with continued outsized growth in depreciation as the company owns more of the clubs its opens. BJ plans to be disciplined from an overall cost perspective. Management also noted that the use of automation, such as autonomous robots in inventory, can help minimize footsteps and labor hours, allowing for more labor hours to go towards customer-facing tasks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dollar General&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improved execution leading to trade-in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. In their last earnings call, DG noted that the trade-down between higher income consumers has been accelerating between 4Q and 1Q. Management noted that the reason they didn&apos;t see this trade-down earlier is likely due to some consumers taking a little longer to feel pressure, but also because of improved company execution. DG believes they are in a better spot today to receive trade-down needs than they were 6-9 months ago, which will allow them to create better impacts on their trade-in customers. Specifically, management noted that they are better positioned in their in-stock levels, SKU reduction strategies, and are investing more in their back-to-basics, which is translating to the top line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;No significant changes on SNAP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Management stated that they are watching SNAP carefully and believes that the low income consumer is still under pressure, but has not confirmed any significant changes related to SNAP. They noted that in the past they have seen significant impacts when there are full-scale cuts on SNAP, but it is not as impacted when it is only work requirement changes. They also stated that if there were certain foods removed from SNAP, they would likely see more of a gradual impact than immediate, given that the consumer will not stop buying the foods they regularly eat immediately. Currently, SNAP accounts for ~MSD of DG&apos;s sales.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DICK&apos;S Sporting Goods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;DKS&apos;s position in a difficult macro backdrop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Per management, DKS is uniquely positioned in the marketplace, especially during challenging times, as its offering enables people to go outside and manage stress in an accessible way. Additionally, people are not willing to forgo things they consider essential, such as cleats that fit their kids or running shoes, which they often view as more necessary than discretionary. In terms of Game Changer, management highlighted that it has become an indispensable piece of the youth sports ecosystem and remains confident in the business in a tougher macroeconomic environment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company could benefit from elevated inventory. Exiting 4Q, DKS&apos;s inventory was up 18%, more for other reasons (e.g., its Southern store strategy, strategic investments) versus getting ahead of tariffs. As a result, there could be some unintended benefits from the higher inventory. The inventory consists of some seasonal and some core product, and it was a focused investment into certain brands categories that have been fueling top line growth to keep the momentum going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foot Locker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FL&apos;s tariff exposure&lt;/strong&gt;. FL&apos;s private label is a LSD percent of sales, with about half of that being sourced through China and the balance through other Southeast Asian countries. FL&apos;s partners also have exposure to China, while noting their exposure to that region has come down over the past several years, particularly following 2018/19 tariffs. Per management, the company is working through this with their partners through a lens of mutual profitability. FL noted that their outlook for the year still suggests that they will continue to make progress against their Lace Up plan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FL noted its inventory was in a good place coming out of 4Q. &lt;/strong&gt;FL&apos;s inventory levels were up 1% coming out of 4Q, and the company saw improved inventory turns last year. Per management, FL wants to leave some flexibility to lean into any traffic-driving promotions, rather than needing to clear inventory. In terms of inventory management, FL plans to continue to be agile and respond to the overall macro environment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ollie&apos;s Bargain Outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supply chain opportunity and flexibility in the current environment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Management addressed investor concerns that supply chain opportunities could be limited in the near term if tariffs persist, by noting that OLLI has already factored that into their strategies, and is continuing to aggressively buy product. In the case that supply chain products are limited, management is not worried given that there is still a lot of merchandise from distressed stores and bankruptcies. While they have not currently seen mass cancellations of orders yet, they highlighted that once more imports arrive from China, companies will have to start canceling orders, likely allowing OLLI to benefit from this excess merchandise. Management also noted that they are currently buying more domestic product and are not buying certain product categories from China (the only category at risk is seasonal items); however, they are not worried about their product mix, as their consumers are trained for a treasure hunt environment. Given OLLI does not have a set planogram merchandise model, consumers are not expecting them to have the same products every time, which allows OLLI&apos;s buyers to flexibly chase different products.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoration Hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RH plans to work through its elevated inventory which will help with FCF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; RH has $200-300mn in excess inventory, with the company noting it bought heavily in advance into its new collections which were trending well. RH plans to work through the inventory this year, without providing a timeline on when this will be done. The company is not buying as much unless it is new collections (i.e., new items in its sourcebooks) or for customers&apos; custom orders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;While the macro remains challenging, RH seeks to benefit from newness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; RH sees an impact on its customer base when mortgage rates go above 7%. In terms of correlation with the stock market, wealthy customers might wait and not purchase in a certain month, and in general, the company sees a correlation between mortgage rates and existing home sales. Per management, RH set out to gain market share with newness, noting that from 2019-22, the company did not offer newness. RH noted it is currently benefiting from the transformation through market share gains, given its compelling offering, scale, and pricing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Levers RH could pull in a difficult environment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. RH noted it could potentially monetize assets through sale leasebacks, which it has done in the past. The company added that its marketing spend is over $100mn, which it could cut back on, along with salaries, corporate headcount, or ongoing projects/investments. RH pointed to its 4/6/20 press release (linked here) as an example of what it has done historically.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prices will likely increase, while elasticity is hard to predict.&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of direct exposure to China, private label is 30% of sales, and 30% of their private label comes from China. Direct imports are more in home and apparel, while indirect is more of electronics and toys. TGT noted that unit demand is going to be tough, and elasticity is hard to predict as it changes over time depending on the macro backdrop. Per management, the expectation is that everyone will have to take price. That said, TGT highlighted that it maintains a strong balance sheet and feels good about its ability to manage this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TGT plans to remain agile on its inventory position&lt;/strong&gt;. TGT noted it has not brought in product early to any great degree in the current environment as there is not limitless storage, while adding it has a mindset to remain ready and agile. We would note that TGT ended the year with ~7% y/y inventory growth, which management noted in March was a function of strategic decisions versus sitting on unproductive inventory. Given TGT&apos;s guests over-index to interest in newness and on-trend product, the company was trying to get a jump start on the year and pulled forward some receipts (e.g., spring sets for hardlines and apparel).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ulta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop openings will pause in 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; At a recent conference, ULTA mentioned it would not be opening additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations this year and would instead be focusing on the existing 610 stores. Per ULTA, this decision will allow the company to incorporate learnings and strengthen existing stores before continuing the expansion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ULTA&apos;s tariff exposure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. In FY24, only ~1% of ULTA&apos;s receipts were direct imports, noting this is mostly related to the Ulta Beauty Collection and gifts with purchases. ULTA is talking with its manufacturers and suppliers on how to mitigate tariff impacts. The Ulta Beauty Collection has exposure to China but also Canada and Europe. Prestige brands are more exposed to North America and Europe, while mass has more exposure to China/Asia. On the indirect side, it is more difficult as ULTA works with 600 brands, which includes smaller brands without broad global supply chains.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ulta hires new Chief Merchandise Officer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. On 4/17, Ulta announced they hired Lauren Brindley as their new Chief Merchandising Officer to replace retiring CMO, Monica Arnaudo. When speaking with the company, they highlighted Ms. Brindley&apos;s more than 20 years of experience in beauty, from both the retail and brand perspective and her experience and relationships across the beauty spectrum, from mass to luxury. Ms. Brindley also led the development of the Boots No 7 brand and has strong brand building experience. Additionally, having served as a CEO of Revolution Beauty, she brings an enterprise view to the merchandising and digital role.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walmart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discretionary categories are underperforming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. WMT has not pulled forward inventory in anticipation of tariffs due to the uncertain backdrop. The company plans to lean heavily into value, noting the more discretionary side of general merchandise is underperforming. That said, seasonal events remain productive for WMT, and the company plans to focus on grocery for upcoming events, while for back-to-school, it will lean into consumables.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WMT is benefiting from automation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. 60% of WMT&apos;s fulfillment volume today is moving through automation, and ~55% of stores are receiving automated freight. The automation cycle is scheduled to roll out through 2029, with cost savings already there today but not sizable enough yet to call out. As a result of automation, inventory efficiency has increased over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sam&apos;s Club is well-positioned for omnichannel growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. WMT is positioning Sam&apos;s Club as an omnichannel club, noting that the market still feels underpenetrated. The Sam&apos;s Club and Walmart US e-commerce supply chains are merging, and e-commerce fulfillment will be done through the Walmart system. As a result, per management, the cost is much lower and the network already exists. While clubs are usually for a stock up versus a top up trip, prepared meals is one of the fastest growing areas for Sam&apos;s Club.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Petco&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commentary on tariffs and pricing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Management noted that owned brands represent 5% of COGS with exposure in China, Mexico, and Canada, with China being the largest. The company also noted that price hike and 10+ mitigation strategies have been under consideration with the aim to mitigate potential impacts on national brands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Competition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The company had no specific update on peer activity. Management has been focused on defining Petco&apos;s position in the market and identifying differential points. The company is focused on understanding the core customer with an emphasis on internal brand definition, analyzing broader industry dynamics, and going back to retail basics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key takeaway is clear: investors and consumers should favor retailers with supply chains outside of China, while penalizing those that are heavily reliant on Chinese imports. &lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>What American Hardline Retailers Are Saying about Tariff Fallout

            
Goldman analysts met with management and investor relations teams from specialty hardline retailers (BBY, BJ, DG, DKS, FL, OLLI, RH, TGT, ULTA, WMT, WOOF) to assess tariff exposure, consumer behavior, and macroeconomic challenges amid 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and the average US tariff rate at its highest since the 1930s. 



Here are the conversations Kate McShane, Mark Jordan, and other analysts had with IR and management teams from retailers: 
Best Buy
Tariff exposure and impacts. Given President Trump&apos;s recent exclusion of electronics from tariffs, management noted that their exposure is likely even lower than the 20% remaining China tariff. BBY is still trying to figure out their tariff situation by talking to vendors, but noted that most of their COGS that originate from Mexico are under exclusion as well (leaving them at low exposure for Mexico). Management also emphasized that the tariff exposure to comp headwind correlation is not linear, as vendors have multiple sites of manufacturing and it is largely dependent on the trade offs vendors make. When comparing tariffs to 2018/2019, they noted that last time, tariffs came through on large appliances, and most of the product categories did not get hit much since they were also exempted. At the moment, management does not believe they have taken prices up (they anticipate tariffs impacting 2Q-4Q), and as of last earnings call, have not brought in any inventory early for tariffs.
Navigating consumer elasticity and macroenvironment. Management stated that their guidance takes into account their potential estimate for consumer elasticity, as they accounted for factors such as product levels, vendor price increases, potential declines in purchased units, etc. They are also involved in weekly planning given the macro-environment, and are preparing themselves and their vendors to be ready in case of any quick tariff changes. In the case of a recession, management noted that there are still many levers they could move to preserve profitability, such as changing labor demand and reducing various SG&amp;A expenses.
BJ&apos;s Wholesale Club
BJ could benefit as a limited SKU retailer when it comes to tariffs. General merchandise comprises less than 15% of BJ&apos;s overall business. Management explained that BJ&apos;s limited SKU count and reliance on a treasure hunt experience gives the company more flexibility than some others. For example, BJ could forgo certain SKUs and offset that with other SKUs, making calculated choices depending on the situation.
BJ expects to see SG&amp;A deleverage this year but automation helps offset. On the 4Q earnings call, BJ guided to SG&amp;A deleverage, driven by an acceleration in new club openings, particularly with continued outsized growth in depreciation as the company owns more of the clubs its opens. BJ plans to be disciplined from an overall cost perspective. Management also noted that the use of automation, such as autonomous robots in inventory, can help minimize footsteps and labor hours, allowing for more labor hours to go towards customer-facing tasks.
Dollar General
Improved execution leading to trade-in. In their last earnings call, DG noted that the trade-down between higher income consumers has been accelerating between 4Q and 1Q. Management noted that the reason they didn&apos;t see this trade-down earlier is likely due to some consumers taking a little longer to feel pressure, but also because of improved company execution. DG believes they are in a better spot today to receive trade-down needs than they were 6-9 months ago, which will allow them to create better impacts on their trade-in customers. Specifically, management noted that they are better positioned in their in-stock levels, SKU reduction strategies, and are investing more in their back-to-basics, which is translating to the top line.
No significant changes on SNAP. Management stated that they are watching SNAP carefully and believes that the low income consumer is still under pressure, but has not confirmed any significant changes related to SNAP. They noted that in the past they have seen significant impacts when there are full-scale cuts on SNAP, but it is not as impacted when it is only work requirement changes. They also stated that if there were certain foods removed from SNAP, they would likely see more of a gradual impact than immediate, given that the consumer will not stop buying the foods they regularly eat immediately. Currently, SNAP accounts for ~MSD of DG&apos;s sales.
DICK&apos;S Sporting Goods
DKS&apos;s position in a difficult macro backdrop. Per management, DKS is uniquely positioned in the marketplace, especially during challenging times, as its offering enables people to go outside and manage stress in an accessible way. Additionally, people are not willing to forgo things they consider essential, such as cleats that fit their kids or running shoes, which they often view as more necessary than discretionary. In terms of Game Changer, management highlighted that it has become an indispensable piece of the youth sports ecosystem and remains confident in the business in a tougher macroeconomic environment.
The company could benefit from elevated inventory. Exiting 4Q, DKS&apos;s inventory was up 18%, more for other reasons (e.g., its Southern store strategy, strategic investments) versus getting ahead of tariffs. As a result, there could be some unintended benefits from the higher inventory. The inventory consists of some seasonal and some core product, and it was a focused investment into certain brands categories that have been fueling top line growth to keep the momentum going.

FL&apos;s tariff exposure. FL&apos;s private label is a LSD percent of sales, with about half of that being sourced through China and the balance through other Southeast Asian countries. FL&apos;s partners also have exposure to China, while noting their exposure to that region has come down over the past several years, particularly following 2018/19 tariffs. Per management, the company is working through this with their partners through a lens of mutual profitability. FL noted that their outlook for the year still suggests that they will continue to make progress against their Lace Up plan.
FL noted its inventory was in a good place coming out of 4Q. FL&apos;s inventory levels were up 1% coming out of 4Q, and the company saw improved inventory turns last year. Per management, FL wants to leave some flexibility to lean into any traffic-driving promotions, rather than needing to clear inventory. In terms of inventory management, FL plans to continue to be agile and respond to the overall macro environment.
Ollie&apos;s Bargain Outlet
Supply chain opportunity and flexibility in the current environment. Management addressed investor concerns that supply chain opportunities could be limited in the near term if tariffs persist, by noting that OLLI has already factored that into their strategies, and is continuing to aggressively buy product. In the case that supply chain products are limited, management is not worried given that there is still a lot of merchandise from distressed stores and bankruptcies. While they have not currently seen mass cancellations of orders yet, they highlighted that once more imports arrive from China, companies will have to start canceling orders, likely allowing OLLI to benefit from this excess merchandise.

Given OLLI does not have a set planogram merchandise model, consumers are not expecting them to have the same products every time, which allows OLLI&apos;s buyers to flexibly chase different products.

RH plans to work through its elevated inventory which will help with FCF. RH has $200-300mn in excess inventory, with the company noting it bought heavily in advance into its new collections which were trending well. RH plans to work through the inventory this year, without providing a timeline on when this will be done. The company is not buying as much unless it is new collections (i.e., new items in its sourcebooks) or for customers&apos; custom orders.
While the macro remains challenging, RH seeks to benefit from newness. RH sees an impact on its customer base when mortgage rates go above 7%. In terms of correlation with the stock market, wealthy customers might wait and not purchase in a certain month, and in general, the company sees a correlation between mortgage rates and existing home sales. Per management, RH set out to gain market share with newness, noting that from 2019-22, the company did not offer newness. RH noted it is currently benefiting from the transformation through market share gains, given its compelling offering, scale, and pricing.
Levers RH could pull in a difficult environment. RH noted it could potentially monetize assets through sale leasebacks, which it has done in the past. The company added that its marketing spend is over $100mn, which it could cut back on, along with salaries, corporate headcount, or ongoing projects/investments. RH pointed to its 4/6/20 press release (linked here) as an example of what it has done historically.
Target
Prices will likely increase, while elasticity is hard to predict. In terms of direct exposure to China, private label is 30% of sales, and 30% of their private label comes from China. Direct imports are more in home and apparel, while indirect is more of electronics and toys. TGT noted that unit demand is going to be tough, and elasticity is hard to predict as it changes over time depending on the macro backdrop.

Ulta
Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop openings will pause in 2025. At a recent conference, ULTA mentioned it would not be opening additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations this year and would instead be focusing on the existing 610 stores. Per ULTA, this decision will allow the company to incorporate learnings and strengthen existing stores before continuing the expansion.
ULTA&apos;s tariff exposure. In FY24, only ~1% of ULTA&apos;s receipts were direct imports, noting this is mostly related to the Ulta Beauty Collection and gifts with purchases. ULTA is talking with its manufacturers and suppliers on how to mitigate tariff impacts. The Ulta Beauty Collection has exposure to China but also Canada and Europe. Prestige brands are more exposed to North America and Europe, while mass has more exposure to China/Asia. On the indirect side, it is more difficult as ULTA works with 600 brands, which includes smaller brands without broad global supply chains.
Ulta hires new Chief Merchandise Officer. On 4/17, Ulta announced they hired Lauren Brindley as their new Chief Merchandising Officer to replace retiring CMO, Monica Arnaudo. When speaking with the company, they highlighted Ms. Brindley&apos;s more than 20 years of experience in beauty, from both the retail and brand perspective and her experience and relationships across the beauty spectrum, from mass to luxury. Ms. Brindley also led the development of the Boots No 7 brand and has strong brand building experience. Additionally, having served as a CEO of Revolution Beauty, she brings an enterprise view to the merchandising and digital role.
Walmart
Discretionary categories are underperforming. WMT has not pulled forward inventory in anticipation of tariffs due to the uncertain backdrop. The company plans to lean heavily into value, noting the more discretionary side of general merchandise is underperforming. That said, seasonal events remain productive for WMT, and the company plans to focus on grocery for upcoming events, while for back-to-school, it will lean into consumables.
WMT is benefiting from automation. 60% of WMT&apos;s fulfillment volume today is moving through automation, and ~55% of stores are receiving automated freight. The automation cycle is scheduled to roll out through 2029, with cost savings already there today but not sizable enough yet to call out. As a result of automation, inventory efficiency has increased over time.
Sam&apos;s Club is well-positioned for omnichannel growth. WMT is positioning Sam&apos;s Club as an omnichannel club, noting that the market still feels underpenetrated. The Sam&apos;s Club and Walmart US e-commerce supply chains are merging, and e-commerce fulfillment will be done through the Walmart system. As a result, per management, the cost is much lower and the network already exists. While clubs are usually for a stock up versus a top up trip, prepared meals is one of the fastest growing areas for Sam&apos;s Club.
Petco
Commentary on tariffs and pricing: Management noted that owned brands represent 5% of COGS with exposure in China, Mexico, and Canada, with China being the largest. The company also noted that price hike and 10+ mitigation strategies have been under consideration with the aim to mitigate potential impacts on national brands.
Competition: The company had no specific update on peer activity. Management has been focused on defining Petco&apos;s position in the market and identifying differential points. The company is focused on understanding the core customer with an emphasis on internal brand definition, analyzing broader industry dynamics, and going back to retail basics.
The key takeaway is clear: investors and consumers should favor retailers with supply chains outside of China, while penalizing those that are heavily reliant on Chinese imports.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Do Elite Universities Really Wish To Fight The Federal Government?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harvard has refused to accept the orders of a Trump administration commission concerning its chronic problems with anti-Semitism, campus violence, and racial tribalism, bias, and segregation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-21_08-50-35.jpg?itok=KrYaoUb9&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-21_08-50-35.jpg?itok=KrYaoUb9&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;77c7a1d7-54fe-4e3f-91ea-3d5bc15597f6&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;282&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-21_08-50-35.jpg?itok=KrYaoUb9&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, unlike some conservative campuses that distrust an overbearing Washington, Harvard and most elite schools like it want it both ways. They do as they please on their own turf and yet still demand that the taxpayers send them multibillion-dollar checks in addition to their multibillion-dollar private incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside from the issues of autonomy and free expression, there are lots of campus practices that higher education would prefer were not widely known to the public.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But soon they will be, and thus will become sources of public anger. Perhaps envision elite private colleges as mossy rocks, which seem outwardly picturesque—until you turn them over and see what crawls beneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if there are protracted standoffs, our elite campuses will be hard-pressed to defend the indefensible. This effort will be difficult because public confidence in higher education has already plummeted to historic lows in the most recent polls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Amerispeak public surveys, those expressing very little confidence or none at all in higher education have soared to about 30 percent of respondents, while those polling only “some” confidence rose to 40%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polls show that less than a third of Americans have quite a lot of confidence in our college campuses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wonder: Over the past half-century, tuition has generally risen at twice the rate of inflation. In part, that price-gouging became standard because federal aid to our most prestigious schools has skyrocketed, hand-in-glove with the federalized student loan program. It has become a $1.7 trillion entity in which the combined rate of both those students who defaulted on their guaranteed loans or are currently late on payments is nearing 12-13 percent. In sum, colleges counted on an ensured stream of tuition money and so raised their prices inordinately, given federal guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that small private Hillsdale College, which takes no federal money and is the guarantor of its own generous student aid, charges about $45,000-50,000 for combined tuition, room, and board—about half the going rate in the Ivy League and similar elite campuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Half the youth of the country who choose to go straight to work and not attend college might object to such use of their tax dollars. &lt;/strong&gt;They would assume that universities with multibillion-dollar endowments and huge annual incomes have plenty of resources to guarantee their own student loans. That way, campuses would have a financial interest in seeing their own students graduate in four years, get jobs, and pay back their alma mater promptly and fully. Instead, as long as universities are paid upfront, they seem to care little that their graduates leave heavily in debt and occasionally default on their loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is almost no intellectual diversity on campus. &lt;/strong&gt;Some recent studies have found Democrat/liberal professors outnumber their Republican/conservative counterparts by a 10-1 margin, especially in the social sciences and humanities. There are plenty of conservative PhDs on the market, but higher education has used insidious methods such as diversity oaths and covert political bias to find ways not to hire or retain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colleges no longer believe in their ancient mission to teach students the ancient, disinterested, and inductive method of pursuing knowledge. Nor do they care much that their graduates leave college without a broad classical education in history, literature, language, philosophy, science, and math. Instead, they are missionaries who believe their duty is to indoctrinate youth in progressive ideology, found mostly in studies courses and deductive classes, as part of a greater project to fundamentally alter the nature of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supreme Court in a recent case ruled against Harvard and the University of North Carolina, stating that their use of racial and gender bias is illegal under the 14th Amendment and thus affirmative action and associated racial essentialism are forbidden.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, many of our campuses simply rebrand their offices of “diversity/equity/inclusion” —the campus euphemism for using race and gender bias in applications, hiring, retention, and promotion—with newer Orwellian names like the “Office of Belonging” or “Community Outreach.” Universities are higher education’s version of sanctuary cities that likewise cavalierly believe they can largely ignore federal laws with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example, it’s illegal to segregate university events or facilities by race. But universities sidestep the law by offering race-based graduation ceremonies as “auxiliary” or “additional” events and commemorations. &lt;/strong&gt;Racially segregated dorms are deemed “theme” houses open to all but de facto widely known as racially exclusive. If the so-called “white” minority at Stanford—some 22 percent of the student body—opted for an “extra” white graduation ceremony, theoretically open to all students, the university would—and should—shut it down promptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In business and private entities, “overhead deductions” or “surcharges” usually run from 10 to 20 percent. But elite private universities charge the federal government for their faculty research grants, often between 40 and 60 percent. Apparently, they operate on the principle that their supposedly prestigious brands deserve private exemption from gouging the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, foreign governments, without audit, have poured some $60 billion into America’s purportedly most prestigious universities. Communist China and illiberal Qatar alone gave $500 million last year. And they expect and receive something for their ideologically driven investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Education during the first Trump administration fined many campuses millions of dollars for not reporting these often quid pro quo gifts. &lt;strong&gt;If one wonders why hundreds of thousands of foreign students from dictatorial and often anti-American nations like China and Middle Eastern autocracies prove instrumental in growing anti-American and anti-Israel protests, then follow the money that funds professorships and programs sympathetic to these agendas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bill of Rights and its later amendments apply to everyone everywhere in the United States. But these laws are especially operative on those entities that take federal government money and, by doing so, forfeit some of their operational autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yet disruptions of invited lecturers who are conservative, pro-Israeli, pro-life, or who question biological males competing in female sports are commonplace on campus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, when an invited conservative federal judge, a Republican officeholder, a traditionalist activist, or a professor deemed not conservative is shouted down, or the lecture hall is swarmed with disruptive and sometimes violent student protestors, campus administrators issue pro forma stern statements about “not tolerating violations of free speech.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then, they do nothing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most campus officials either empathize with the spirit or the ideology of the disrupters. Or they are far more afraid of their own radical professors and students than they are of the federal government cutting off their funding for refusing to guarantee First Amendment protections. Harvard arguing for federal funds on the principle of protecting the First Amendment is adding insult to the serial injury it has done to free speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More cynically, most campus administrators assume that if conservative pro-life students ever swarmed a pro-abortion lecturer, or Jewish students ransacked a Middle East Studies classroom or chased and then trapped foreign students in a library, then they would likely be summarily expelled. Most naturally assume that universities’ selective timidity and laxity are ideologically and politically driven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no guarantee of due process on campus, as understood under the Bill of Rights. Students or faculty who are accused of particular hot-button “crimes,” such as sexual harassment or “hate speech,” are often denied the right to know their accusers or to have an open hearing with legal counsel before a disinterested panel of judges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The wronged have little redress of grievance except to use the public court system to intervene to force the university to follow the law.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best-kept secret of our marquee universities is a radical fall-off in standards as once defined by their own, once much ballyhooed, tough requirements. Our best universities customarily now ensure that 70-80 percent of students in their classes receive A’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prestigious campuses, like Harvard and Stanford, have recently introduced remedial math classes. &lt;/strong&gt;Privately, the supposedly most demanding campuses know that their prior non-meritocratic admissions have resulted in thousands of students who enter college without the high-school preparation necessary to meet their own past traditional university requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative, Jewish, and religious families now doubt whether their offspring would be treated equitably or would receive a first-rate education commensurate with the four-year total $400,000 cost, or are even now safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When pressed, universities usually point to their professional and graduate schools in medicine, engineering, math, science, and business as integral to American prosperity. True, they are. But to the degree they are, it is likely because they have either resisted university orthodoxy or were never as politicized as the social sciences and humanities, or are already being weaponized, albeit more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If universities were smart, they would accept federal conditions to follow the law and protect the safety and interests of their own students.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way, they would restore their academic rigor and reputations, regain public support, and enhance meritocracy, the key to their former excellence. But even if their officials are either too partisan or timid to change, they could always publicly report to their radical faculties and students that they were “forced” to comply with conditions that they might privately accept were certainly in their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Otherwise, at the present rate, employers, parents, and the public will make the necessary adjustments, and the brands once deemed the gold standard and prestigious will become mere dross.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Do Elite Universities Really Wish To Fight The Federal Government?

            
Authored by Victor Davis Hanson via American Greatness,

      <title>&quot;It&apos;s Time For A Change&quot;: Canadian Youth Fed Up, Turn To Conservative Poilievre As Liberal Boomers Go Full Carney</title>

Like many young Canadians, Zorrilla is fed up - and &lt;strong&gt;he’s placing his hopes in Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre&lt;/strong&gt;, while the Liberal Party is seeking a fourth term after globalist Justin Trudeau was forced to take the L.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/AFP__20250109__36TF3L6__v1__HighRes__CanadaPoliticsPoilievre-1743532080.jpg?itok=GdGB_d89&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/AFP__20250109__36TF3L6__v1__HighRes__CanadaPoliticsPoilievre-1743532080.jpg?itok=GdGB_d89&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ddb07540-1861-4812-a708-137cac337eab&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/AFP__20250109__36TF3L6__v1__HighRes__CanadaPoliticsPoilievre-1743532080.jpg?itok=GdGB_d89&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Conservative Party of Canada [File: Dave Chan/AFP Photo]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;It’s time for a change&lt;/strong&gt;,” Zorrilla told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-17/canada-s-gen-z-voters-turn-to-conservative-poilievre-in-race-against-carney&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, heading into a Poilievre campaign stop near Vancouver. Though Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is out of the picture, Zorrilla isn’t buying the Liberals&apos; rebrand. “&lt;strong&gt;Still the same rock band&lt;/strong&gt;,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That frustration is bubbling over across Canada’s younger voters. Once wooed by promises of legalized pot and eco-friendly reforms, &lt;strong&gt;Millennials and Gen Z are now reeling from runaway housing prices and a cost-of-living crisis&lt;/strong&gt; that’s left dreams of home ownership and early retirement in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Poilievre has found resonance among the youth - &lt;strong&gt;roughly 39% of 18-to-34-year-olds back the Conservatives vs. 36% for the Liberals,&lt;/strong&gt; per &lt;a href=&quot;https://nanos.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-2783-ELXN-FED-2025-04-15_Field-Ended.pdf&quot;&gt;Nanos Research&lt;/a&gt;, not enough to catapult him ahead but still significant. With less than two weeks before election day, Prime Minister Mark Carney’s Liberals are holding a narrow lead overall, &lt;strong&gt;thanks in part to strong support from Canadian boomers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carney, 60, is virtually a stranger to the TikTok generation. His political playbook caters more to Baby Boomers than Zoomers, like the ad where he and “Austin Powers” star Mike Myers wax nostalgic about Mr. Dressup and The Tragically Hip. Good luck finding a Gen Z’er who knows who Howie Meeker is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it’s that very throwback charm that’s roped in voters like Tracy Nice, a 64-year-old lifelong Conservative who flipped blue over Carney’s steady hand and Canada’s souring relationship with the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Carney just seems like a very smart, calm, thoughtful man who I trust&lt;/strong&gt;,” Nice said. “And obviously the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England trusted him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poilievre, meanwhile, has taken a different approach&lt;/strong&gt;. He’s leaned into the social media era, ditching stuffy suits for tight tees, donning aviators, and even puffing hookah with a shawarma shop owner on YouTube while chatting about cryptocurrency. His message? &lt;strong&gt;Axe taxes, cut red tape, and let Canadians save - all wrapped in a swagger that channels online populism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As Mark Jeftovic of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bombthrower.com/iconic-symbol-of-liberal-arrogance-goes-viral-for-the-wrong-reasons/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bombthrower.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes, Canadian boomers are generally dicks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The Liberal base has had it easy for a decade. With a compliant, sycophantic press and a loyal army of boomers—presumably the only ones still answering calls from pollsters on their wall-mounted rotary-dial landlines during CBC commercial breaks—they greet any resistance to the prospect of four more years of controlled demolition of the Canadian economy with smugness and derision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are endless cases caught on video of deranged elderly liberals gyrating in spasmodic fashion chanting “elbows up” at each other and the rest of us and they seem to think it’s some kind of “gotcha moment” to fly off the handle or flip us the bird…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it&apos;s no mystery why young men are flocking to the Conservatives - though the gender gap is hard to ignore. Twice as many women support Carney’s Liberals, while nearly half of male voters back Poilievre. Liberals were quick to pounce on the Tory leader’s use of the phrase “biological clock” during a speech on housing affordability, accusing him of tone-deafness on gender issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Poilievre’s style is coded masculine&lt;/strong&gt;,” said Laura Stephenson, a political science professor at Western University. “&lt;strong&gt;And the Conservative Party in general... has often been favored by men over women.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the youth surge behind Poilievre marks a generational reversal. Traditionally, young Canadians leaned left, while older voters skewed conservative. Now, with sky-high rents and stalled economic growth, the Liberal record is falling flat — even as the party racks up wins on progressive policies like pharmacare and dental care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have legalized marijuana, we have pharmacare, we have dental care,” said Stephenson. “What many [young voters] still struggle with, though, is paying rent, or buying a home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/canada%20h.JPG?itok=7G_StRpc&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/canada%20h.JPG?itok=7G_StRpc&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;4af64a45-c7ac-499f-9b43-7bb7bdd9cc65&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;331&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/canada%20h.JPG?itok=7G_StRpc&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, for Poilievre, may be his most potent talking point yet. Whether it’s enough to close the gap before voters hit the polls,&lt;strong&gt; that’s the billion-dollar question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>&quot;It&apos;s Time For A Change&quot;: Canadian Youth Fed Up, Turn To Conservative Poilievre As Liberal Boomers Go Full Carney

            
It was a rainy March evening in British Columbia, but that didn’t stop 29-year-old Giancarlo Zorrilla from attending his first political rally. Like many young Canadians, Zorrilla is fed up - and he’s placing his hopes in Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, while the Liberal Party is seeking a fourth term after globalist Justin Trudeau was forced to take the L.

“It’s time for a change,” Zorrilla told Bloomberg, heading into a Poilievre campaign stop near Vancouver. Though Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is out of the picture, Zorrilla isn’t buying the Liberals&apos; rebrand. “Still the same rock band,” he quipped.
That frustration is bubbling over across Canada’s younger voters. Once wooed by promises of legalized pot and eco-friendly reforms, Millennials and Gen Z are now reeling from runaway housing prices and a cost-of-living crisis that’s left dreams of home ownership and early retirement in the dust.
While Poilievre has found resonance among the youth - roughly 39% of 18-to-34-year-olds back the Conservatives vs. 36% for the Liberals, per Nanos Research, not enough to catapult him ahead but still significant. With less than two weeks before election day, Prime Minister Mark Carney’s Liberals are holding a narrow lead overall, thanks in part to strong support from Canadian boomers.



Carney, 60, is virtually a stranger to the TikTok generation. His political playbook caters more to Baby Boomers than Zoomers, like the ad where he and “Austin Powers” star Mike Myers wax nostalgic about Mr. Dressup and The Tragically Hip. Good luck finding a Gen Z’er who knows who Howie Meeker is.
Yet it’s that very throwback charm that’s roped in voters like Tracy Nice, a 64-year-old lifelong Conservative who flipped blue over Carney’s steady hand and Canada’s souring relationship with the U.S.
“Carney just seems like a very smart, calm, thoughtful man who I trust,” Nice said. “And obviously the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England trusted him.”
Poilievre, meanwhile, has taken a different approach. He’s leaned into the social media era, ditching stuffy suits for tight tees, donning aviators, and even puffing hookah with a shawarma shop owner on YouTube while chatting about cryptocurrency. His message? Axe taxes, cut red tape, and let Canadians save - all wrapped in a swagger that channels online populism.
As Mark Jeftovic of Bombthrower.com notes, Canadian boomers are generally dicks:
The Liberal base has had it easy for a decade. With a compliant, sycophantic press and a loyal army of boomers—presumably the only ones still answering calls from pollsters on their wall-mounted rotary-dial landlines during CBC commercial breaks—they greet any resistance to the prospect of four more years of controlled demolition of the Canadian economy with smugness and derision.
There are endless cases caught on video of deranged elderly liberals gyrating in spasmodic fashion chanting “elbows up” at each other and the rest of us and they seem to think it’s some kind of “gotcha moment” to fly off the handle or flip us the bird…

      <title>Vatican Countdown: Here Are The Candidates For New Pope </title>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Vatican Countdown: Here Are The Candidates For New Pope &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (1628ET): &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pope Francis&apos; death earlier this morning triggered centuries-old traditions and rules within the Roman Catholic Church, including mourning and the selection of a new leader. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the key steps in selecting the new pope: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vacancy of the Papal See:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The process begins when the papacy becomes vacant, typically due to the death of the reigning pope or, more rarely, resignation (e.g., Pope Benedict XVI in 2013).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Camerlengo, a cardinal appointed to manage the Church&apos;s temporal affairs during the vacancy, verifies the pope&apos;s death (historically by tapping the forehead and calling his baptismal name) and assumes interim administrative duties.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation for the Conclave:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The College of Cardinals gathers in Rome for General Congregations, daily meetings to handle Church business and prepare for the conclave. These meetings include all cardinals, but only those under 80 years old can vote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The conclave must begin 15–20 days after the vacancy, allowing time for cardinals to travel, though this can be adjusted slightly. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sistine Chapel is prepared as the voting venue, secured to ensure secrecy, with electronic jamming devices to prevent leaks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Conclave:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eligible Voters: Only cardinals under 80 years old at the start of the vacancy can participate (maximum 120 electors, though the number varies; currently ~130 eligible cardinals exist, per Vatican estimates). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seclusion: Cardinals are sequestered in the Domus Sanctae Marthae (a Vatican residence) and the Sistine Chapel, swearing oaths of secrecy. No external communication is allowed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voting Process: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voting occurs in the Sistine Chapel, with two rounds in the morning and two in the afternoon each day. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cardinals write a name on a ballot, fold it, and place it in a chalice, saying, &quot;I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A two-thirds majority (e.g., 80 of 120 votes) is required to elect a pope. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If no candidate achieves this, the ballots are burned with a chemical to produce black smoke (indicating no decision). If a candidate secures two-thirds, the ballots are burned to produce white smoke, signaling a new pope.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrutiny and Counting: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three scrutineers (elected cardinals) count votes, with infirmarii collecting ballots from any sick cardinals. Ballots are burned after each session.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadlock Provisions: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;After ~13 days (33–34 ballots) without a two-thirds majority, cardinals may vote to reduce the requirement to a simple majority or hold a runoff between the top two candidates (per Universi Dominici Gregis).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance and Announcement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If elected, the candidate is asked by the Dean of the College of Cardinals: &quot;Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?&quot; and, if yes, &quot;By what name will you be called?&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new pope chooses a papal name (e.g., John Paul, Francis) and is vested in papal garments. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cardinal Protodeacon announces &quot;Habemus Papam&quot; (&quot;We have a pope&quot;) from the balcony of St. Peter&apos;s Basilica, introducing the new pope&apos;s name and title. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pope imparts the Urbi et Orbi blessing to the crowd in St. Peter&apos;s Square.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are the contenders to be the next pope (list courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://succeed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pietro Parolin, 70, Italy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seen as a moderate &quot;continuity candidate&quot;, Parolin was close to Francis. He has been the Vatican&apos;s secretary of state since 2013, playing a key role in diplomatic affairs, including delicate negotiations with China and governments in the Middle East. He is regarded as a reliable and trusted papal representative by secular diplomats. In 2018, he was the driving force behind a controversial agreement with the Chinese government on the appointment of bishops, criticised by some as a sellout to the communist regime. Parolin&apos;s critics see him as a modernist and a pragmatist who places ideology and diplomatic solutions above hard truths of the faith. To his supporters, he is a courageous idealist and avid proponent of peace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luis Antonio Tagle, 67, the Philippines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tagle, a former archbishop of Manila, would be the first Asian pope, the region with the fastest-growing Catholic population. At one time he was considered to be Francis&apos;s preferred successor and a strong contender to continue the late pope&apos;s progressive agenda, but recently appears to have fallen out of favour. He has suggested that the Catholic church&apos;s stance on gay and divorced couples is too harsh, but has opposed abortion rights in the Philippines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Turkson, 76, Ghana&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turkson would be the first black pope in centuries. He has been vocal on issues such the climate crisis, poverty and economic justice while affirming the church&apos;s traditional positions on the priesthood, marriage between a man and a woman, and homosexuality. However, his views on the latter have loosened and he has argued that laws in many African countries are too harsh. He has spoken out on corruption and human rights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Péter Erdő, 72, Hungary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leading conservative candidate, Erdő has been a strong advocate for traditional Catholic teachings and doctrine. He would represent a big shift away from Francis&apos;s approach. He is widely regarded as a great intellect and a man of culture. Erdő was a favourite of the late cardinal George Pell who believed he would restore the rule of law in the post-Francis Vatican. In 2015, Erdő appeared to align himself with Hungary&apos;s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, when he opposed Francis&apos;s call for churches to take in migrants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matteo Zuppi, 69, Italy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appointed a cardinal by Francis in 2019, Zuppi is considered to be on the progressive wing of the church, and would be expected to continue Francis&apos;s legacy, sharing the late pope&apos;s concern for the poor and marginalised. He is (relatively) liberal on same-sex relationships. Two years ago, Francis made him the Vatican peace envoy for Ukraine, in which capacity he visited Moscow to &quot;encourage gestures of humanity&quot;. While there he met Patriarch Kirill, the leader of the Russian Orthodox church and Vladimir Putin&apos;s ally. He has also met Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine&apos;s president.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;José Tolentino Calaça de Mendonça, 59, Portugal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tolentino is one of the youngest potential successors to Francis, which could count against him – ambitious cardinals may not want to wait another 20 or 30 years before another shot at the top job. He has attracted controversy for sympathising with tolerant views on same-sex relationships and allying himself with a feminist Benedictine sister who favours women&apos;s ordination and is pro-choice. He was close to Francis on most issues, and argues that the church must engage with modern culture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mario Grech, 68, Malta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grech was seen as a traditionalist but began to embrace more progressive views after Francis was elected in 2013. His supporters argue that his changing opinions show his capacity for growth and change. He has criticised European political leaders who sought to limit the activities of NGO ships and has expressed support for female deacons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, Italy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since 2020, Pizzaballa has been the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, a crucial role in advocating for the Christian minority in the Holy Land. After Hamas&apos;s attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, Pizzaballa offered himself as a hostage in exchange for children who were being held by Hamas in Gaza. He visited Gaza in May 2024 after months of negotiations. He would be expected to continue some aspects of Francis&apos;s leadership of the church, but has made few public statements on controversial issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Sarah, 79, Guinea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarah is a traditional, Orthodox cardinal who at one time sought to present himself as a &quot;parallel authority&quot; to Francis, according to a Vatican observer. In 2020, he co-authored a book with the then retired Pope Benedict defending clerical celibacy that was seen as a challenge to Francis&apos;s authority. He has denounced &quot;gender ideology&quot; as a threat to society, and has spoken out against Islamic fundamentalism. Like Turkson, he could make history as the first black pope in centuries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vatican News reports that Pope Francis died at the age of 88 at 7:35 a.m. local time (1:35 a.m. EST). Earlier this year, he experienced a severe health crisis that resulted in over a month of hospitalization due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/medical/pope-franciss-condition-worsens-after-respiratory-crisis-vatican&quot;&gt;double pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2025-04/pope-francis-dies-on-easter-monday-aged-88.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the death of the 266th pope via this statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Dearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis. At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favor of the poorest and most marginalized. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vatican News provided more color on the Pope&apos;s deteriorating health leading up to his death on Easter Monday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pope was admitted to the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital on Friday, February 14, 2025, after suffering from a bout of bronchitis for several days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pope Francis&apos; clinical situation gradually worsened, and his doctors diagnosed bilateral pneumonia on Tuesday, February 18.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After 38 days in hospital, the late Pope returned to his Vatican residence at the Casa Santa Marta to continue his recovery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To his 1.3 billion followers, Francis signaled a more inclusive stance toward LGBTQ+ Catholics and advocated for open borders in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis was the first pope from Latin America, the first Jesuit to become the head of the Catholic Church, and the first to take the name Francis, inspired by St. Francis of Assisi, who gave up his vast amounts of wealth to live in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout his tenure (March 13, 2013 to April 21, 2025), Francis also spoke about multiple recurring themes, including compassion, humility, and advocacy. He told followers, &quot;My people are poor, and I am one of them.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance met with Francis to exchange Easter greetings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know you have not been feeling great, but it&apos;s good to see you in better health,&quot; Vance told the Pope, adding, &quot;Thank you for seeing me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Vatican Countdown: Here Are The Candidates For New Pope 

            
Update (1628ET): 
Pope Francis&apos; death earlier this morning triggered centuries-old traditions and rules within the Roman Catholic Church, including mourning and the selection of a new leader. 
Here are the key steps in selecting the new pope: 
Vacancy of the Papal See:

	
The process begins when the papacy becomes vacant, typically due to the death of the reigning pope or, more rarely, resignation (e.g., Pope Benedict XVI in 2013).
The Camerlengo, a cardinal appointed to manage the Church&apos;s temporal affairs during the vacancy, verifies the pope&apos;s death (historically by tapping the forehead and calling his baptismal name) and assumes interim administrative duties.
Preparation for the Conclave:

	
The College of Cardinals gathers in Rome for General Congregations, daily meetings to handle Church business and prepare for the conclave. These meetings include all cardinals, but only those under 80 years old can vote.
The conclave must begin 15–20 days after the vacancy, allowing time for cardinals to travel, though this can be adjusted slightly. 
The Sistine Chapel is prepared as the voting venue, secured to ensure secrecy, with electronic jamming devices to prevent leaks.
The Conclave:

	
Eligible Voters: Only cardinals under 80 years old at the start of the vacancy can participate (maximum 120 electors, though the number varies; currently ~130 eligible cardinals exist, per Vatican estimates). 
Seclusion: Cardinals are sequestered in the Domus Sanctae Marthae (a Vatican residence) and the Sistine Chapel, swearing oaths of secrecy. No external communication is allowed.
Voting Process: 

	
Voting occurs in the Sistine Chapel, with two rounds in the morning and two in the afternoon each day. 
Cardinals write a name on a ballot, fold it, and place it in a chalice, saying, &quot;I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge.&quot; 
A two-thirds majority (e.g., 80 of 120 votes) is required to elect a pope. 
If no candidate achieves this, the ballots are burned with a chemical to produce black smoke (indicating no decision). If a candidate secures two-thirds, the ballots are burned to produce white smoke, signaling a new pope.
Scrutiny and Counting: 
Three scrutineers (elected cardinals) count votes, with infirmarii collecting ballots from any sick cardinals. Ballots are burned after each session.
Deadlock Provisions: 
After ~13 days (33–34 ballots) without a two-thirds majority, cardinals may vote to reduce the requirement to a simple majority or hold a runoff between the top two candidates (per Universi Dominici Gregis).
Acceptance and Announcement:

	
If elected, the candidate is asked by the Dean of the College of Cardinals: &quot;Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?&quot; and, if yes, &quot;By what name will you be called?&quot; 
The new pope chooses a papal name (e.g., John Paul, Francis) and is vested in papal garments. 
The Cardinal Protodeacon announces &quot;Habemus Papam&quot; (&quot;We have a pope&quot;) from the balcony of St. Peter&apos;s Basilica, introducing the new pope&apos;s name and title. 
The pope imparts the Urbi et Orbi blessing to the crowd in St. Peter&apos;s Square.


Who are the contenders to be the next pope (list courtesy of The Guardian):
Pietro Parolin, 70, Italy
Seen as a moderate &quot;continuity candidate&quot;, Parolin was close to Francis. He has been the Vatican&apos;s secretary of state since 2013, playing a key role in diplomatic affairs, including delicate negotiations with China and governments in the Middle East. He is regarded as a reliable and trusted papal representative by secular diplomats. In 2018, he was the driving force behind a controversial agreement with the Chinese government on the appointment of bishops, criticised by some as a sellout to the communist regime. Parolin&apos;s critics see him as a modernist and a pragmatist who places ideology and diplomatic solutions above hard truths of the faith. To his supporters, he is a courageous idealist and avid proponent of peace.
Luis Antonio Tagle, 67, the Philippines
Tagle, a former archbishop of Manila, would be the first Asian pope, the region with the fastest-growing Catholic population. At one time he was considered to be Francis&apos;s preferred successor and a strong contender to continue the late pope&apos;s progressive agenda, but recently appears to have fallen out of favour. He has suggested that the Catholic church&apos;s stance on gay and divorced couples is too harsh, but has opposed abortion rights in the Philippines.
Peter Turkson, 76, Ghana
Turkson would be the first black pope in centuries. He has been vocal on issues such the climate crisis, poverty and economic justice while affirming the church&apos;s traditional positions on the priesthood, marriage between a man and a woman, and homosexuality. However, his views on the latter have loosened and he has argued that laws in many African countries are too harsh. He has spoken out on corruption and human rights.
Péter Erdő, 72, Hungary
A leading conservative candidate, Erdő has been a strong advocate for traditional Catholic teachings and doctrine. He would represent a big shift away from Francis&apos;s approach. He is widely regarded as a great intellect and a man of culture. Erdő was a favourite of the late cardinal George Pell who believed he would restore the rule of law in the post-Francis Vatican. In 2015, Erdő appeared to align himself with Hungary&apos;s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, when he opposed Francis&apos;s call for churches to take in migrants.
Matteo Zuppi, 69, Italy
Appointed a cardinal by Francis in 2019, Zuppi is considered to be on the progressive wing of the church, and would be expected to continue Francis&apos;s legacy, sharing the late pope&apos;s concern for the poor and marginalised. He is (relatively) liberal on same-sex relationships. Two years ago, Francis made him the Vatican peace envoy for Ukraine, in which capacity he visited Moscow to &quot;encourage gestures of humanity&quot;. While there he met Patriarch Kirill, the leader of the Russian Orthodox church and Vladimir Putin&apos;s ally. He has also met Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine&apos;s president.
José Tolentino Calaça de Mendonça, 59, Portugal
Tolentino is one of the youngest potential successors to Francis, which could count against him – ambitious cardinals may not want to wait another 20 or 30 years before another shot at the top job. He has attracted controversy for sympathising with tolerant views on same-sex relationships and allying himself with a feminist Benedictine sister who favours women&apos;s ordination and is pro-choice. He was close to Francis on most issues, and argues that the church must engage with modern culture.
Mario Grech, 68, Malta
Grech was seen as a traditionalist but began to embrace more progressive views after Francis was elected in 2013. His supporters argue that his changing opinions show his capacity for growth and change. He has criticised European political leaders who sought to limit the activities of NGO ships and has expressed support for female deacons.
Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, Italy
Since 2020, Pizzaballa has been the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, a crucial role in advocating for the Christian minority in the Holy Land. After Hamas&apos;s attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, Pizzaballa offered himself as a hostage in exchange for children who were being held by Hamas in Gaza. He visited Gaza in May 2024 after months of negotiations. He would be expected to continue some aspects of Francis&apos;s leadership of the church, but has made few public statements on controversial issues.
Robert Sarah, 79, Guinea
Sarah is a traditional, Orthodox cardinal who at one time sought to present himself as a &quot;parallel authority&quot; to Francis, according to a Vatican observer. In 2020, he co-authored a book with the then retired Pope Benedict defending clerical celibacy that was seen as a challenge to Francis&apos;s authority. He has denounced &quot;gender ideology&quot; as a threat to society, and has spoken out against Islamic fundamentalism. Like Turkson, he could make history as the first black pope in centuries.
Could American Cardinal Raymond Burke be in the running?

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, the activist org Indivisible, sponsored by Linked-In billionaire Reid Hoffman and dark money “pass through” funder the Tides Foundation (Bill Gates and others), sent its “protest” troops into the streets to pretend that there is public support for national suicide. &lt;strong&gt;It was a pitiful showing, after all. There are only so many mind-fucked Boomers out there who can be marshaled to militate for the psychopathocracy behind these monied actors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easter weekend looked like a turning point in this struggle for sanity over the public interest. On Saturday night, the SCOTUS shot its wad staying the deportation of Venezuelan gang-bangers rounded-up by ICE in Texas. Do you suppose that means the executive branch is powerless now to remove anyone who entered the USA illegally? It’s alleged that the illegal aliens have a right to some &lt;em&gt;due process&lt;/em&gt; beyond their deportation orders — which themselves entail sufficient due process to execute their removal, since entering the country illegally is an actionable violation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, millions of illegal immigrants ditched their own identity documents before crossing into the USA, so there is no way of even establishing who they actually are, were they to appear in an American court for any proposed &lt;em&gt;due process&lt;/em&gt; sorting-out. The identity erasure was carried out deliberately to confound the law, and was part of the concerted efforts of NGOs working with the “Joe Biden” regime to stuff illegals into the country as fast as possible with no vetting whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was, you understand, an elaborately engineered operation, down to the CPB One cell phone app created by the US Department of Homeland Security itself under Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to mass produce phony asylum cases that streamlined illegal entry for millions. &lt;/strong&gt;This was complemented by the DHS program of “humanitarian parole and travel authorization” to enter the US on commercial flights directly from foreign countries, bypassing customs interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivation for all that was understood by anyone with a functional brain: to assemble a new voter cohort, using motor-voter procedures and mail-in ballots to guarantee Democratic Party election victories in key districts for all time to come. It couldn’t have been more cynically corrupt, as is the new campaign to prevent these millions of new fake voters from being deported back to where they came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this points to the question: what can be done about such an arrant insult to the citizens of our country? The consternation arises from the failure of federal appeals courts, and now even the SCOTUS, to end the coup. What’s needed is a raft of major DOJ prosecutions for the serious crimes around the vast panoply of lawfare operations going back to 2016. I believe they are coming and that the reason you hear nothing lately out of the DOJ and the FBI is because the cases are under construction and details about them have not been leaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good place to start would be a case for mass murder, battery, obstruction of justice, and lying to Congress against the people responsible for the Covid-19 caper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed last week — though &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and the cable news networks didn’t report it — that the White House issued a major document titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/?s=01&quot;&gt;Lab Leak; the True Origins of Covid 19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The doc succinctly outlines the case that Anthony Fauci of NIAID and Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina presided over the design of the Covid-19 virus and outsourced its production, with the help of Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance, to the Wuhan Virology Institute lab. Include the CEOs or Pfizer and Moderna, Francis Collins, Rochelle Walensky, and their chief deputies at CDC, and Stephen Hahn, Janet Woodcock, and Robert Califf all serially chiefs of the FDA from 2020 to 2024, for enabling the phony and harmful Covid Vaccine program. Indict them all. Let a jury decide if Dr. Fauci’s preemptive pardon was legitimate. The others enjoy no pardon protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring cases against, John Brennan, James Comey, and a long list of DOJ / FBI officials for the crimes around RussiaGate. &lt;/strong&gt;Include Judge James “Jeb” Boasberg for his activities running the FISA court during the period. Indict them under federal statute 18 USC 371, Conspiracy to Defraud the United States. Throw in sedition and possibly treason, since the UK’s MI6 agency was a party to the seditious frauds involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indict Alejandro Mayorkas &lt;/strong&gt;and his deputies, and the White House aides manipulating “Joe Biden,” for engineering the mass entry of illegal immigrants between January 2021 and 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring cases against Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party leadership for instigating the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol building, as well as the DNC / RNC pipe bomb hoax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigate the previously ignored incidents of voter fraud in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Georgia in the 2020 election.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indict Joe Biden and his family for bribery and treason for their money laundering activities in Ukraine, China, Kazakhstan and elsewhere during Biden’s years as vice-president and the period when he was out-of-office, 2017 to 2021 (and enjoyed no immunity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indict Norm Eisen, Mary McCord, Andrew Weissmann, and Lisa Monaco for organizing the malicious prosecutions of Donald Trump in 2024 in Georgia, Florida, the District of Columbia, and New York City. And bring a case against Eisen and his assistants for orchestrating the current judicial coup outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start making this happen, Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, and you will begin to shatter the giant glass cloche of cognitive dissonance that holds the minds of half the country hostage to a long-running Jacobin conspiracy aimed at wrecking the country.&lt;/strong&gt; You will at least witness a startling shift in what the people pay attention to. Call it retribution if you like. It represents payback for a host of crimes committed against the American people by government officials who warred against them. It is well-deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>The Great Consternation

            
Authored by James Howard Kunstler,
&quot;Due process is when only one side has to follow the law and if you point out that this is a suicidal standard you’re a fascist”
- Auron MacIntyre
A great consternation boils and bubbles across the land as the sinister forces of Jacobin lawfare keep up their legalistic battery against the nation. You better believe that the country will not stand for much more of this lunatic judicial coup aimed at wrecking the authority of law itself, and with that, any chance for sane management of our affairs.



On Saturday, the activist org Indivisible, sponsored by Linked-In billionaire Reid Hoffman and dark money “pass through” funder the Tides Foundation (Bill Gates and others), sent its “protest” troops into the streets to pretend that there is public support for national suicide. It was a pitiful showing, after all. There are only so many mind-fucked Boomers out there who can be marshaled to militate for the psychopathocracy behind these monied actors.
Easter weekend looked like a turning point in this struggle for sanity over the public interest. On Saturday night, the SCOTUS shot its wad staying the deportation of Venezuelan gang-bangers rounded-up by ICE in Texas.

However, one bright spot emerged on X around midday: aerial images show that Cybercab prototype builds may have already begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Tegtmeyer, a certified flight instructor, snapped high-resolution aerial images of the Tesla Giga Texas earlier today, which revealed what could be castings of the new Cybercab vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting developments next to the Giga Texas Casting Machine section today … several new kinds of castings that do not look like Model Y or @cybertruck … looking for experts out there to identify these in the comments&lt;/strong&gt;!&quot; Tegtmeyer wrote on X. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla investor Sawyer Merritt &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1914382487809351796&quot;&gt;quoted&lt;/a&gt; Tegtmeyer&apos;s post on X, explaining:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;These do appear to be to rear Cybercab castings. The Cybertruck casting racks are marked with CTTX, which means Cybertruck Texas. On these new images from Joe today we can see RTTX, which likely means Robotaxi Texas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Tesla has been installing Cybercab production equipment for months. Two months ago in a public interview Lars Moravy said that the first Cybercab prototype builds were slated to start this summer, with general mass production to start in early 2026&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OblCcO7-Alg&quot;&gt;latest episode of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OblCcO7-Alg&quot;&gt;Club Random&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Bill Maher sat down with Turning Point USA founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/charliekirk11&quot;&gt;Charlie Kirk&lt;/a&gt; for what many expected to be a clash of political opposites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2827%29_5.jpg?itok=mvVd9vON&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2827%29_5.jpg?itok=mvVd9vON&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;6a09a25d-60bf-4ace-8550-537f63c065bf&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2827%29_5.jpg?itok=mvVd9vON&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what unfolded was something far more surprising: a candid, wide-ranging conversation that revealed just how much common ground these two actually share—especially when it comes to calling out the modern left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It kicked off with a sharp joke from Kirk, who warned &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/billmaher&quot;&gt;Maher&lt;/a&gt; that the “purple-hair jihadis” would be coming for him next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They want to kill me just as bad. Oh, they really do!” &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/billmaher&quot;&gt;Maher&lt;/a&gt; responded. He explained, “&lt;strong&gt;They hate their own apostates more&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m supposed to get on the short bus to crazy town with them—and I won’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, Maher began to draw a clear line between classic liberal values and what he called the “woke” ideology taking over the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am one of them! They’re not one of me,” he said. “Liberal and woke are two completely different things—woke is very often the opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher explained, “Liberalism is, &lt;strong&gt;let’s live in a colorblind society&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s the goal. Woke’s goal is, ‘&lt;strong&gt;We see race everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;.’ Liberal is, ‘There’s a two-state solution.’ Woke is ‘river to the sea.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came a line that cut to the core of his frustration: “&lt;strong&gt;You got off the F-train, you fell asleep, and you got off at 20 stops too far. Don’t blame me for that&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, of course! Of all the low-lying fruit the Democrats just hand the Republicans to win elections, that’s the one,” Maher responded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk grinned and asked, “Are they really gonna let us win every national election on this no-men-in-women’s-sports thing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher answered bluntly: “It’s so ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He cited the stat that &lt;strong&gt;890 trophies had already gone to biological males competing in women’s events&lt;/strong&gt;—and even pointed out that California’s own Gavin Newsom had backed away from the debate.&lt;/p&gt;

Because they just don’t feel that this is like a real person.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He got even more honest: “And I know it’s so weird to say that about Donald Trump, who I’ve said a jillion times is, you know, a whiny little b*tch, I could go through my greatest hits of insults.

      <contentSnippet>Bill Maher Tells Charlie Kirk What&apos;s Really Destroying The Democratic Party

            
Via The Vigilant Fox,
On the latest episode of Club Random, Bill Maher sat down with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk for what many expected to be a clash of political opposites.



But what unfolded was something far more surprising: a candid, wide-ranging conversation that revealed just how much common ground these two actually share—especially when it comes to calling out the modern left.
It kicked off with a sharp joke from Kirk, who warned Maher that the “purple-hair jihadis” would be coming for him next.
“They want to kill me just as bad. Oh, they really do!” Maher responded. He explained, “They hate their own apostates more. I’m supposed to get on the short bus to crazy town with them—and I won’t.”
From there, Maher began to draw a clear line between classic liberal values and what he called the “woke” ideology taking over the Democratic Party.
“I am one of them! They’re not one of me,” he said. “Liberal and woke are two completely different things—woke is very often the opposite.”
Maher explained, “Liberalism is, let’s live in a colorblind society. That’s the goal. Woke’s goal is, ‘We see race everywhere.’ Liberal is, ‘There’s a two-state solution.’ Woke is ‘river to the sea.’”
Then came a line that cut to the core of his frustration: “You got off the F-train, you fell asleep, and you got off at 20 stops too far. Don’t blame me for that.”
What started as a typical podcast on Club Random quickly turned into something way more revealing. @charliekirk11 and Bill Maher weren’t clashing on everything—they were connecting over one uncomfortable truth: the woke cult is tearing the country apart.

The conversation pivoted to an issue even some liberals are struggling to defend: women’s sports. Kirk praised Maher for speaking out.
“You deserve credit for being a liberal that acknowledges male-female distinctions,” he said.
“Oh, of course! Of all the low-lying fruit the Democrats just hand the Republicans to win elections, that’s the one,” Maher responded.
Kirk grinned and asked, “Are they really gonna let us win every national election on this no-men-in-women’s-sports thing?”
Maher answered bluntly: “It’s so ridiculous.”
He cited the stat that 890 trophies had already gone to biological males competing in women’s events—and even pointed out that California’s own Gavin Newsom had backed away from the debate.
“You lost Gavin Newsom on this,” he said. “Take that as a hint.”
The conversation then shifted—this time to an issue even many liberals have started to question——sports.

      <title>&quot;China Will Never Accept It&quot;: Beijing Warns Countries Against Trade Deal With Trump At China&apos;s Expense</title>

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s starting to smell like a real trade war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just days after the WSJ reported that Scott Bessent&apos;s grand trade war strategy was to force more than 70 US trade partners to sign bilateral deals while aligning against China, &lt;strong&gt;Beijing has warned it will retaliate against countries that negotiate trade deals with the US “at the expense of China’s interests”, &lt;/strong&gt;fueling global tensions as the world’s two economic superpowers lunge at each other over tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests,” the ministry said on Monday. &lt;strong&gt;“If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“China respects the right of all parties to resolve their economic and trade differences with the United States through equal consultations,” the commerce ministry said adding that if countries encroached on Beijing’s interests, it was “determined and capable of safeguarding its own rights”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ministry added that “all parties should stand on the side of fairness and justice and should defend international economic and trade rules and the multilateral trading system”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It said:&lt;strong&gt; “Once international trade returns to the ‘law of the jungle’, where the strong prey on the weak, all countries will become victims.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_3277f51446f143eda489a1bd5de6f72f.html&quot;&gt;statement by China&apos;s commerce ministry,&lt;/a&gt; which was in response to reports that Trump’s administration planned to use trade talks with multiple countries to try to isolate China, called &lt;strong&gt;on them to instead join Beijing to “resist unilateral bullying.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sharp escalation follows the failure to gain any traction in trade and tariff negotiations. Trump has called several times for Beijing to open negotiations to avert a trade war, and China has said it is open to talks, but neither side has signalled that high-level contacts are under way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While last week&apos;s WSJ report said the US strategy to gang up on China was intended to pressure Beijing to come to the negotiating table and abandon its defiant stance, China has shown little sign of backing down. Instead, president Xi Jinping visited Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia last week, where he sought to shore up relations with Beijing’s trading partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South-east Asian exporters face steep tariffs under the Trump administration, which has also accused them of serving as a transshipment conduit for Chinese goods. Unfortunately for them, without the US as a final customer for most of their exports (including Chinese transshipments), and vows of solidarity will be hollow once countless Pacific rim factories go dark &lt;strong&gt;sparking an economic and labor crisis in countries which have virtually no social safety net.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while China has ironically sought to portray itself as a pillar of the international trading system, it is struggling with weak domestic demand following a deep property slowdown, forcing policymakers to lean on manufacturing and exports for economic growth and leaving the economy vulnerable to the trade war with the US. As a reminder, some 40% of Chinese economic growth is in the form of trade, and while the hit to the US would be mostly along the inflationary and capital market pathways, once more than a third of China&apos;s economy is forced to find new end markets,  the pain for the domestic economic will be orders of magnitude worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s also why Goldman now expects &lt;strong&gt;China&apos;s Q2 real GDP growth to collapse to 0.8% qoq ann from 4.9% in Q1. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Beijing has repeatedly promised various initiatives to spur consumption but has held back from launching a “bazooka” fiscal stimulus (something it can&apos;t do since it has hit debt saturation), instead investing heavily in industry to shake off its reliance on western technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;&quot;That&apos;s Creepy AF&quot;: Whose Hand Is This? &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why has public confidence in the Democratic Party collapsed to record lows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the party that champions illegal alien terrorists and cultural Marxism lost its authenticity a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voters see right through the bullshit of lies, non-sense identity politics, performative accents, and teleprompter-scripted speeches. The American people became outraged last week after Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/political/socialist-aoc-bernie-sanders-caught-using-private-jets-while-fighting-oligarchy-tour&quot;&gt;caught flying around on private jets&lt;/a&gt; while &quot;fighting oligarchy.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the rudderless party is being thrown into a civil war, caught between old-school moderates and far-left activists like David Hogg, Jasmine Crockett, Hakeem Jeffries, and AoC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest Gallup polling data was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/political/confidence-democratic-leadership-sinks-record-low-party-implodes&quot;&gt;nothing more than disastrous&lt;/a&gt; for the party of wokeism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Democratic leadership&apos;s latest 25% confidence rating is an all-time low for the group — well below the previous 34% low recorded in 2023 and the average of 45% since 2001,&quot; Gallup wrote in a report, adding, &quot;Confidence ratings were last at the majority level in 2009 for Democratic congressional leaders and in 2003 for Republican congressional leaders.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all of this—and returning to the theme of authenticity—it&apos;s no surprise that a majority of Americans have gravitated toward the &apos;America First&apos; movement. President Trump doesn&apos;t need a teleprompter; he speaks his mind directly and genuinely, which resonates with people who just want peace and prosperity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/political/tesla-takedown-organizers-plan-color-revolution-kill-brand-death-spiral-investors&quot;&gt;not domestic terrorism and protests&lt;/a&gt; that Democrats seem to have embraced in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the theme of authenticity in mind, internet sleuths point out that the Biden team may have photoshopped the former president into a family Easter photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As some users noted on X, the giveaway was a strangely placed, almost creepy-looking hand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>&quot;That&apos;s Creepy AF&quot;: Whose Hand Is This? 

            
Why has public confidence in the Democratic Party collapsed to record lows?
In short, the party that champions illegal alien terrorists and cultural Marxism lost its authenticity a long time ago.
Voters see right through the bullshit of lies, non-sense identity politics, performative accents, and teleprompter-scripted speeches. The American people became outraged last week after Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders were caught flying around on private jets while &quot;fighting oligarchy.&quot; 
Meanwhile, the rudderless party is being thrown into a civil war, caught between old-school moderates and far-left activists like David Hogg, Jasmine Crockett, Hakeem Jeffries, and AoC. 
The latest Gallup polling data was nothing more than disastrous for the party of wokeism:
&quot;Democratic leadership&apos;s latest 25% confidence rating is an all-time low for the group — well below the previous 34% low recorded in 2023 and the average of 45% since 2001,&quot; Gallup wrote in a report, adding, &quot;Confidence ratings were last at the majority level in 2009 for Democratic congressional leaders and in 2003 for Republican congressional leaders.&quot; 



Given all of this—and returning to the theme of authenticity—it&apos;s no surprise that a majority of Americans have gravitated toward the &apos;America First&apos; movement. President Trump doesn&apos;t need a teleprompter; he speaks his mind directly and genuinely, which resonates with people who just want peace and prosperity, not domestic terrorism and protests that Democrats seem to have embraced in recent weeks. 
With the theme of authenticity in mind, internet sleuths point out that the Biden team may have photoshopped the former president into a family Easter photo.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;The Death Cross And Market Bottoms&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/the-death-cross-and-market-bottoms/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In financial markets, few technical patterns generate as much attention and anxiety as &lt;strong&gt;the death cross&lt;/strong&gt;. This ominous-sounding term refers to a crossover on a price chart when a short-term moving average, most commonly the 50-day moving average (50-DMA), drops below a long-term moving average, usually the 200-day moving average (200-DMA). The &lt;em&gt;“death cross”&lt;/em&gt; is a fantastic headline for the media to generate clicks and views. However, for investors, the &lt;em&gt;“death cross”&lt;/em&gt; signals a market correction and suggests a more cautious investing approach. But there are a few questions we must answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What does the death cross mean?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How reliable is it as an indicator?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And how should investors respond when they see it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s answer those questions by exploring the death cross’s history, data, and interpretations, and explaining why context matters more than the signal itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Trader-Bear-Market-Liquidity-e17.jpg?itok=E50imApu&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Trader-Bear-Market-Liquidity-e17.jpg?itok=E50imApu&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;4e57f7b4-800e-47df-9af2-b43d01654b06&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Trader-Bear-Market-Liquidity-e17.jpg?itok=E50imApu&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is the Death Cross?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Investopedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The “death cross” market chart pattern refers to the drop of a short-term moving average—meaning the average of recent closing prices for a stock, stock index, commodity, or cryptocurrency over a set period of time—below a longer-term moving average. The most closely watched stock-market moving averages are the 50-day and the 200-day.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For investors, it is essential to note that the death cross is a lagging indicator. It only tells you that price action has deteriorated during the previous two months. In other words, it often only confirms an already obvious trend because it relies on historical data from moving averages. Furthermore, when the death cross occurs, markets are often near a short-term low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss to state that there are periods where the death cross preceded more severe bear markets of the past century, including 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008. However, that is an example of sample selection bias, expressed by using only the selected data points to prove the predictive power of the death cross. Unfortunately, selecting only those data points ignores the numerous occasions when the death cross signaled nothing worse than a market correction and provided significant buying opportunities for investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the following table from Marketwatch shows that since 1950, markets tend to rise within the next 12 months following a death cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-151.jpg?itok=FjHPteKq&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-151.jpg?itok=FjHPteKq&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;f5ee85f4-5659-48da-b5bc-d337a641fadc&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-151.jpg?itok=FjHPteKq&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because, as noted, the markets tend to be very oversold by the time the death cross triggers, and previous optimistic sentiment has reversed. We noted this in this past weekend’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/is-risk-off-positioning-signaling-a-market-low/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;#BullBearReport.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For example, net bullish sentiment among retail and institutional investors is at some of the lowest levels on record, including during the “Financial Crisis.” The extreme negativity is interesting because the recent decline was orderly and mild compared to the chaos during the financial crisis. Yet, investors are as bearish on the current market as they were then. However, it is worth noting that during previous instances when sentiment was as negative as it is currently, such readings were near market bottoms.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-143%20%281%29.jpg?itok=oeGy281-&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-143%20%281%29.jpg?itok=oeGy281-&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;cec02408-7ea5-4f80-bcee-c1373fb7f26a&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-143%20%281%29.jpg?itok=oeGy281-&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Furthermore, the sharp spike in the volatility index, which is considered a “market fear gauge,” spiked to the highest levels seen since the COVID pandemic. If we combine the sentiment measures with the volatility index, we again see more extreme negative readings that often coincide with market lows rather than the beginning of larger reversions.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-144%20%281%29.jpg?itok=bHwCE9h9&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-144%20%281%29.jpg?itok=bHwCE9h9&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;f161f12d-8d6a-4a30-b3f8-6f02abd7e304&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-144%20%281%29.jpg?itok=bHwCE9h9&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, historically speaking, the death cross, more often than not, is a potential contrarian indicator. However, as noted above, there have been instances where the death cross led to much more severe declines. How can investors differentiate between the two?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-structural-bear-markets-versus-event-driven-corrections&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Bear Markets Versus Event-Driven&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Corrections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the media often dramatizes the appearance of a death cross, seasoned investors know it is just one piece of the puzzle. Corrections are part of a normal and healthy market process. As discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/bullish-years-often-have-corrections/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Bullish Years Have Corrections Too:”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In bullish years, markets often have corrections. Yet, after a lengthy bullish run, it always surprises me how quickly investors and the media panic with the slightest hint of a market pullback. During bullish years, corrections happen more often than you think. However, when corrections occur, it is not uncommon to see concerns about a “bear market” rise. However, historically speaking, the stock market increases about 73% of the time. The other 27% of the time, market corrections reverse the excesses of the previous advance.

&lt;p&gt;The correction from this year’s market peak is currently in a range that has only occurred 7% of the time historically, with the market declining 19.4% from peak to trough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far this year, the market decline certainly ranks among some of the worst-performing years in history. However, we are only one-third of the way into 2025, so how this year ends is still widely unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Annual-vs-Intra-Year-Returns-202.jpg?itok=YOiy2Q4m&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Annual-vs-Intra-Year-Returns-202.jpg?itok=YOiy2Q4m&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;dc7a0a09-03de-469d-a55c-047705037d63&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Annual-vs-Intra-Year-Returns-202.jpg?itok=YOiy2Q4m&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is worth noting that since 1980, only eight (8) years have ended with more significant declines. Could this be the ninth? Yes, but for that to occur, we must put previous market declines and larger bear markets into context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between whether the death cross is a shorter-term corrective process or a larger &lt;em&gt;“bear market” decline &lt;/em&gt;depends mainly on whether the cause of the market decline is &lt;em&gt;“event-driven”&lt;/em&gt; or “&lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt;.” As noted recently by the Daily Shot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Structural bear markets have historically been the deepest and longest, averaging over 55% declines and lasting nearly four years. In contrast, event-driven bears tend to be shorter and shallower, with quicker recoveries—averaging around 30% declines and under 10 months in duration. Post-WWII averages (orange diamonds) suggest more moderate outcomes relative to the broader historical record.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-154.jpg?itok=duXwFsGk&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-154.jpg?itok=duXwFsGk&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;638c8b32-6c6c-4200-bebc-f389fb783729&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-154.jpg?itok=duXwFsGk&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This context is important when examining the current decline and triggering of the &lt;em&gt;“death cross.”&lt;/em&gt; The chart below shows the difference in the length of &lt;em&gt;“event-driven”&lt;/em&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;“structural”&lt;/em&gt; corrections, signified by the triggering of the&lt;em&gt; “death cross.”&lt;/em&gt; The dot.com and financial crisis periods were structural events, as significant corporate failures and credit-market dislocations occurred amid deep economic contractions. However, outside of those two significant structural impacts, all other &lt;em&gt;“events” &lt;/em&gt;were short-lived, and markets soon recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/50-200-DMA-Death-Cross-and-Event.jpg?itok=wu5ZNgj0&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/50-200-DMA-Death-Cross-and-Event.jpg?itok=wu5ZNgj0&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;751d7649-599c-49e2-8ee9-0a087c6207e1&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/50-200-DMA-Death-Cross-and-Event.jpg?itok=wu5ZNgj0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the current market correction is driven by concerns over &lt;em&gt;“tariffs,”&lt;/em&gt; it will likely be short-lived. There are two reasons for this view. First, the announced tariffs, which were more onerous than expected, will likely be largely reduced or removed through negotiations. Second, once the tariffs are finalized, the markets will adjust expectations for earnings and focus on future growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question for investors is how to navigate the current market turmoil until this event-driven correction completes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-navigating-the-uncertainty&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigating The Uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean you should ignore the &lt;em&gt;“death cross”&lt;/em&gt; entirely? No. While the current correction is &lt;em&gt;“event-driven”&lt;/em&gt; and will likely resolve itself soon, there is always a risk that something could trigger a &lt;em&gt;“structural”&lt;/em&gt; decline, such as a recession or credit-related event. &lt;strong&gt;While such a risk remains quite low currently, that risk is not zero.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the death cross should not be viewed in isolation or trigger panic-driven decisions. Instead, investors should use it as a cue to take a more thoughtful approach to their portfolio management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅ Stay the Course if Fundamentals Are Sound&lt;/strong&gt;. If your portfolio is well-diversified and aligned with long-term goals, the death cross may just be &lt;strong&gt;noise&lt;/strong&gt; within a broader market cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🌐 Use It as a Risk Management Cue&lt;/strong&gt;. As we noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/the-market-crash-a-set-up-for-a-rally/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Market Crash: Hope In The Fear,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we used the recent rally in the market to reduce risk, hedge portfolios, raise cash, and rebalance allocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📊 Combine with Other Indicators&lt;/strong&gt;. As noted above, while ominous, the current death cross collides with deeply oversold technical readings, as shown below, which typically suggest markets are near short-term lows rather than starting more significant declines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://sentimentrader.com/&quot;&gt;Sentimentrader&lt;/a&gt; tracks 21 indicators in total, which are then combined into a single indicator, giving readings of when markets are trading at more extreme bullish or bearish levels. As shown, the market is currently trading at more extreme risk-off levels. While this does not mean the market is about to rise, historically, such extreme readings have been close to market bottoms.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-125%20%281%29.jpg?itok=IYlVEAEG&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-125%20%281%29.jpg?itok=IYlVEAEG&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;2fb7ee10-dee9-46ce-8861-ff2b34f0d97e&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;289&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-125%20%281%29.jpg?itok=IYlVEAEG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚡ Consider Rebalancing or Rotating&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether the current period is &lt;em&gt;“event-driven”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“structural&lt;/em&gt;,” the market will have intermittent rallies which investors should use to rebalance risk, reallocate holdings, and increase cash levels to reduce volatility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💡 Don’t Ignore the Golden Cross&lt;/strong&gt;. While it is easy to become overly defensive during a corrective period, it is important to remember that eventually the “death cross” will reverse the crossover. When the 50-DMA rises above the 200-DMA, it creates the golden cross, which follows the market bottom. That signals a reversal of the previous process of reducing risk to increasing risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;h-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The death cross is a useful indicator, not a prophecy. It reflects short-term weakness, but doesn’t dictate the future. The key is to treat it as a &lt;strong&gt;signal to pay closer attention&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to the bigger picture, not a call to sell everything and flee to cash.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term investors should remain focused on &lt;strong&gt;fundamentals, diversification, and goals&lt;/strong&gt;. Short-term traders can use it as one of many tools to refine timing. Either way, understanding the death cross puts you in a better position to act with insight rather than emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>The Death Cross And Market Bottoms

            
Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,
In financial markets, few technical patterns generate as much attention and anxiety as the death cross. This ominous-sounding term refers to a crossover on a price chart when a short-term moving average, most commonly the 50-day moving average (50-DMA), drops below a long-term moving average, usually the 200-day moving average (200-DMA). The “death cross” is a fantastic headline for the media to generate clicks and views. However, for investors, the “death cross” signals a market correction and suggests a more cautious investing approach. But there are a few questions we must answer.

	
What does the death cross mean?
How reliable is it as an indicator?
And how should investors respond when they see it?
Let’s answer those questions by exploring the death cross’s history, data, and interpretations, and explaining why context matters more than the signal itself.



What Is the Death Cross?
According to Investopedia:
“The “death cross” market chart pattern refers to the drop of a short-term moving average—meaning the average of recent closing prices for a stock, stock index, commodity, or cryptocurrency over a set period of time—below a longer-term moving average. The most closely watched stock-market moving averages are the 50-day and the 200-day.”
For investors, it is essential to note that the death cross is a lagging indicator. It only tells you that price action has deteriorated during the previous two months. In other words, it often only confirms an already obvious trend because it relies on historical data from moving averages. Furthermore, when the death cross occurs, markets are often near a short-term low.
I would be remiss to state that there are periods where the death cross preceded more severe bear markets of the past century, including 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008. However, that is an example of sample selection bias, expressed by using only the selected data points to prove the predictive power of the death cross. Unfortunately, selecting only those data points ignores the numerous occasions when the death cross signaled nothing worse than a market correction and provided significant buying opportunities for investors.
For example, the following table from Marketwatch shows that since 1950, markets tend to rise within the next 12 months following a death cross.



This is because, as noted, the markets tend to be very oversold by the time the death cross triggers, and previous optimistic sentiment has reversed. We noted this in this past weekend’s #BullBearReport.
“For example, net bullish sentiment among retail and institutional investors is at some of the lowest levels on record, including during the “Financial Crisis.” The extreme negativity is interesting because the recent decline was orderly and mild compared to the chaos during the financial crisis. Yet, investors are as bearish on the current market as they were then. However, it is worth noting that during previous instances when sentiment was as negative as it is currently, such readings were near market bottoms.”



“Furthermore, the sharp spike in the volatility index, which is considered a “market fear gauge,” spiked to the highest levels seen since the COVID pandemic. If we combine the sentiment measures with the volatility index, we again see more extreme negative readings that often coincide with market lows rather than the beginning of larger reversions.”



In other words, historically speaking, the death cross, more often than not, is a potential contrarian indicator. However, as noted above, there have been instances where the death cross led to much more severe declines. How can investors differentiate between the two?
Structural Bear Markets Versus Event-Driven Corrections
While the media often dramatizes the appearance of a death cross, seasoned investors know it is just one piece of the puzzle. Corrections are part of a normal and healthy market process. As discussed in “Bullish Years Have Corrections Too:”
“In bullish years, markets often have corrections. Yet, after a lengthy bullish run, it always surprises me how quickly investors and the media panic with the slightest hint of a market pullback. During bullish years, corrections happen more often than you think. However, when corrections occur, it is not uncommon to see concerns about a “bear market” rise. However, historically speaking, the stock market increases about 73% of the time. The other 27% of the time, market corrections reverse the excesses of the previous advance. The table below shows the dispersion of returns over time. Critically, note that drawdowns of greater than 10% only occur 13% of the time.”



The correction from this year’s market peak is currently in a range that has only occurred 7% of the time historically, with the market declining 19.4% from peak to trough.



So far this year, the market decline certainly ranks among some of the worst-performing years in history. However, we are only one-third of the way into 2025, so how this year ends is still widely unpredictable.



But it is worth noting that since 1980, only eight (8) years have ended with more significant declines. Could this be the ninth? Yes, but for that to occur, we must put previous market declines and larger bear markets into context.
The difference between whether the death cross is a shorter-term corrective process or a larger “bear market” decline depends mainly on whether the cause of the market decline is “event-driven” or “structural.” As noted recently by the Daily Shot:
“Structural bear markets have historically been the deepest and longest, averaging over 55% declines and lasting nearly four years. In contrast, event-driven bears tend to be shorter and shallower, with quicker recoveries—averaging around 30% declines and under 10 months in duration. Post-WWII averages (orange diamonds) suggest more moderate outcomes relative to the broader historical record.”



This context is important when examining the current decline and triggering of the “death cross.” The chart below shows the difference in the length of “event-driven” versus “structural” corrections, signified by the triggering of the “death cross.” The dot.com and financial crisis periods were structural events, as significant corporate failures and credit-market dislocations occurred amid deep economic contractions. However, outside of those two significant structural impacts, all other “events” were short-lived, and markets soon recovered.



Given that the current market correction is driven by concerns over “tariffs,” it will likely be short-lived. There are two reasons for this view. First, the announced tariffs, which were more onerous than expected, will likely be largely reduced or removed through negotiations. Second, once the tariffs are finalized, the markets will adjust expectations for earnings and focus on future growth.
The question for investors is how to navigate the current market turmoil until this event-driven correction completes.
Navigating The Uncertainty
Does this mean you should ignore the “death cross” entirely? No. While the current correction is “event-driven” and will likely resolve itself soon, there is always a risk that something could trigger a “structural” decline, such as a recession or credit-related event. While such a risk remains quite low currently, that risk is not zero.
Furthermore, the death cross should not be viewed in isolation or trigger panic-driven decisions. Instead, investors should use it as a cue to take a more thoughtful approach to their portfolio management.
✅ Stay the Course if Fundamentals Are Sound. If your portfolio is well-diversified and aligned with long-term goals, the death cross may just be noise within a broader market cycle.
🌐 Use It as a Risk Management Cue. As we noted in “Market Crash: Hope In The Fear,” we used the recent rally in the market to reduce risk, hedge portfolios, raise cash, and rebalance allocations.
📊 Combine with Other Indicators. As noted above, while ominous, the current death cross collides with deeply oversold technical readings, as shown below, which typically suggest markets are near short-term lows rather than starting more significant declines.
“Sentimentrader tracks 21 indicators in total, which are then combined into a single indicator, giving readings of when markets are trading at more extreme bullish or bearish levels. As shown, the market is currently trading at more extreme risk-off levels. While this does not mean the market is about to rise, historically, such extreme readings have been close to market bottoms.”



⚡ Consider Rebalancing or Rotating. Whether the current period is “event-driven” or “structural,” the market will have intermittent rallies which investors should use to rebalance risk, reallocate holdings, and increase cash levels to reduce volatility.
💡 Don’t Ignore the Golden Cross. While it is easy to become overly defensive during a corrective period, it is important to remember that eventually the “death cross” will reverse the crossover. When the 50-DMA rises above the 200-DMA, it creates the golden cross, which follows the market bottom. That signals a reversal of the previous process of reducing risk to increasing risk.
Conclusion
The death cross is a useful indicator, not a prophecy. It reflects short-term weakness, but doesn’t dictate the future. The key is to treat it as a signal to pay closer attention to the bigger picture, not a call to sell everything and flee to cash.
Long-term investors should remain focused on fundamentals, diversification, and goals. Short-term traders can use it as one of many tools to refine timing. Either way, understanding the death cross puts you in a better position to act with insight rather than emotion.

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal jury on Friday convicted former Enochian Biosciences (now Renovaro) &quot;scientific founder&quot;, &quot;inventor&quot; and former largest shareholder Serhat Gumrukcu of orchestrating the 2018 murder-for-hire of his former business partner in Vermont, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://vtdigger.org/2025/04/18/jury-convicts-accused-leader-of-murder-for-hire-plot-that-killed-vermont-man-on-all-charges/&quot;&gt;VTDigger.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jury found Gumrukcu - who was brought to the attention of market participants &lt;a href=&quot;https://hindenburgresearch.com/enochian/&quot;&gt;by former short seller Hindenburg Research back in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, alongside of &lt;a href=&quot;https://sharesleuth.com/enochian-biosciences-stunning-murder-allegations-raise-fresh-questions-about-companys-main-medical-mind/&quot;&gt;ShareSleuth&lt;/a&gt; - guilty on all three felony charges: murder for hire, conspiracy to commit murder for hire, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He now faces a mandatory life sentence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gumrukcu was taken into custody shortly afterward. Jurors deliberated for about six hours, including a lunch break, returning their decision Friday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A supposed mind-reading magician turned biomedical entrepreneur, Serhat Gumrukcu mingled with Hollywood elites and earned millions through unconventional medical ventures.

&lt;p&gt;Though he claimed innocence,&lt;strong&gt; Gumrukcu admitted under oath to lying to authorities and said he&apos;d told “so many lies” in past deals he couldn’t remember them all&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors argued Gumrukcu had Davis killed to prevent him from exposing fraud tied to a failed oil deal—one that could have derailed a lucrative biomedical contract with Enochian BioSciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Gregg Davis was a problem for the defendant,” said prosecutor Paul Van de Graaf. “It was the defendant who paid for the murder.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Van de Graaf outlined how Gumrukcu financed the $200,000 plot, with testimony from three co-conspirators, including former assistant Berk Eratay. Eratay claimed Gumrukcu told him he wanted to “get rid of a problem,” prompting Eratay to enlist others, including hitman Jerry Banks. Banks testified he posed as a U.S. marshal, kidnapped Davis, and executed him in rural Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense attorney Ethan Balogh argued it was Eratay who “ran the op,” not Gumrukcu. He said the funds were meant for a cryptocurrency project and portrayed Davis as untrustworthy. Balogh accused the three key witnesses—who took plea deals to avoid life sentences—of lying to save themselves: “These men were all going to die in the cage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors countered that none of them had a reason to kill Davis—except Gumrukcu. As Van de Graaf said, even “peaceful” men can outsource their violence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Jury Convicts Renovaro Biosciences Founder Of Orchestrating Murder-For-Hire Of His Former Business Partner

            
A federal jury on Friday convicted former Enochian Biosciences (now Renovaro) &quot;scientific founder&quot;, &quot;inventor&quot; and former largest shareholder Serhat Gumrukcu of orchestrating the 2018 murder-for-hire of his former business partner in Vermont, according to VTDigger.com. 
The jury found Gumrukcu - who was brought to the attention of market participants by former short seller Hindenburg Research back in 2022, alongside of ShareSleuth - guilty on all three felony charges: murder for hire, conspiracy to commit murder for hire, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He now faces a mandatory life sentence. 
Gumrukcu was taken into custody shortly afterward. Jurors deliberated for about six hours, including a lunch break, returning their decision Friday afternoon.
Gumrukcu had formerly been praised by Enochian CEO Mark Dybul - who once worked under Anthony Fauci at the National Institute of Health - with Dybul writing in November 2019 that he was &quot;one of those rare geniuses that is not bound by scientific discipline or dogma&quot;. Hindenburg accused Dybul of turning a &quot;blind eye to outrageous fraud&quot; perpetrated by Gumrukcu in a stunning follow up report after the &quot;inventor&apos;s&quot; death.

After being removed from Enochian, the company changed its name and continued without Gumrukcu. The murder for hire case stems from the killing of 39-year-old Gregory Davis, which prosecutors say was ordered by Gumrukcu over a soured oil deal.
“This verdict is the product of years of investigative work,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Drescher, commending the efforts of federal and local law enforcement.
Once a Turkish national living in a Los Angeles mansion, Gumrukcu now awaits formal sentencing later this year. His attorney could not be reached for comment.
A supposed mind-reading magician turned biomedical entrepreneur, Serhat Gumrukcu mingled with Hollywood elites and earned millions through unconventional medical ventures. But during his five-week trial in Burlington, he faced a far different spotlight—three days on the witness stand, denying involvement in the 2018 murder-for-hire of former business partner Gregory Davis.
Though he claimed innocence, Gumrukcu admitted under oath to lying to authorities and said he&apos;d told “so many lies” in past deals he couldn’t remember them all. He acknowledged buying a fake medical degree from Russia, calling it “cheating,” and described his younger self as “arrogant,” advocating unorthodox treatments like leeches and mistletoe.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supreme Court’s ruling in J.G.G. v. Donald J. Trump was not an unqualified triumph for the Trump administration’s deportations of foreign gang members, but it was a definite rebuke not just to Judge Boasberg, but to the entire D.C. Circuit Court shadow government.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image_2025-04-20_213237519.jpg?itok=E6AvwzsY&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_2025-04-20_213237519.jpg?itok=E6AvwzsY&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ab7038eb-26c2-4ad7-9d7a-bf1d2259c7af&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_2025-04-20_213237519.jpg?itok=E6AvwzsY&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ACLU filed J.G.G. v. Trump in defense of five Venezuelan inmates in New York and Texas. All of the men claimed that they were not gang members and there was no indication that any of them were being deported, denying them any actual standing for coming before the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Especially before Judge James Boasberg who is thousands of miles away in Washington D.C.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of standing and the case being filed in the wrong venue, Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court, not only blocked the deportation of all gang members back to Venezuela, but ordered that planes currently over international airspace that were carrying gang members turn around and bring them back to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boasberg fumed that the planes were not turned around on his mere word and threatened the Justice Department with repercussions for not recognizing his power over not only the entire country, but also the entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But why was a judge from the D.C. Circuit Court on a case involving inmates in Texas?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that leftist organizations and the judges of the D.C. Circuit Court were using one weird trick to seize power over the entire country (if not always the planet) and transform themselves into a shadow government able to block any Trump administration move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court’s ruling vacating Boasberg’s order stated that, “the detainees are confined in Texas, so venue is improper in the District of Columbia” and directed that the appropriate “venue lies in the district of confinement”. So how did a D.C. judge ever get involved at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s concurrence he noted that the “only question is where that judicial review should occur. That venue question turns on whether these transfer claims belong in habeas corpus proceedings or instead may be brought under the Administrative Procedure Act.” The Supreme Court’s ruling even noted that “initially the detainees sought relief in habeas among other causes of action, but they dismissed their habeas claims” and stated that “their claims fall within the ‘core’ of the writ of habeas corpus and thus must be brought in habeas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kavanaugh then laid out a brief history of detainees, including those terrorists at Gitmo, bringing claims under habeas corpus rather than, strangely, under the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Administrative Procedure Act had been created in response to the rise of a vast unaccountable government bureaucracy under FDR. The APA was supposed to stop the administrative state from turning into exactly the kind of self-governing machine it grew into which FDR had described&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontpagemag.com/judicial-coup/&quot;&gt; as threatening to&lt;/a&gt; “develop a fourth branch of government for which there is no sanction in the Constitution.” It was not meant to block presidents from executing their policies or subject every one of those policies to the review of the D.C. Circuit Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The D.C. Circuit Court however has enabled every leftist ‘resistance’ group to go ‘judge shopping’ and file APA complaints to block anything and everything President Trump does.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the ACLU appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court, wielding the Administrative Procedure Act, to challenge the question of whether President Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act (which predated the APA by 148 years) applied and what could be defined as wartime. The ACLU was asking Boasberg to block President Trump’s use of presidential powers based on an act meant to check bureaucratic overreach. And Judge Boasberg went ahead and tried to seize control of U.S. forces abroad from President Trump in the name of an act meant to regulate agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supreme Court’s response to this unconstitutional abomination was milder than it deserved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gave the ACLU and Boasberg the idea that they could get away with it? The ACLU had previously sued the Trump administration for removing materials falsely describing the existence of a ‘transgender’ society as a violation of the “Administrative Procedure Act” by “removing articles without a reasoned basis” as if that were a matter subject to the APA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another case, ‘Judge’ Ana Reyes, a Uruguayan activist lawyer appointed by Biden as the first gay ‘Latinx’ judge in the D.C. Circuit Court, blocked the removal of mentally ill individuals who hallucinate the idea that they are members of some other sex than their biological one, by claiming that it’ss “soaked in animus and dripping with pretext, Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit” and argued, despite the mountain of evidence, that the Department of Defense had “not provided a legitimate reason for banning all transgender troops” and therefore violated the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reyes had confused the Administrative Procedure Act with her own personal opinion and rather than ruling on the legality of a policy based on actual laws, abused the APA to seize power over the Pentagon to promote her own favored social and sexual worldviews in the APA’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the Supreme Court has begun shooting down some APA abuses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its response to a Biden judge in Massachusetts blocking the Trump administration from ending education grants that violate its ban on DEI, the court noted that Judge Myong Joun and the court “lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA” and that monetary cases involving the government are supposed to go to the Court of Federal Claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The APA has become a favored weapon of choice whether the issue at hand is financial, foreign policy, deporting illegal aliens or even publishing materials about the existence of transgenderism on government websites. During the first term of the administration, leftist groups had taken to boasting of having entire “teams of APA litigators and experts”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And with a 93% loss rate for the Trump administration in APA cases, the judicial coup was a sound strategy. &lt;/strong&gt;All a leftist judge had to do was declare that the Trump administration’s actions were “poorly reasoned” or lacked “sufficient rationale” and would override the president’s orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The APA enabled a massive shift of power from the executive branch to district courts, and to the D.C. Circuit Court which had seized virtually unlimited power from both the president and local courts and judges in the process creating an unelected shadow government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the D.C. judicial shadow government overreached itself. And Boasberg’s attempt to seize presidential powers has created a constitutional moment of crisis that may unwind the coup.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <contentSnippet>This One Weird Trick Let D.C. Judges Stage A Coup

            
Authored by Daniel Greenfield,
The Supreme Court’s ruling in J.G.G. v. Donald J. Trump was not an unqualified triumph for the Trump administration’s deportations of foreign gang members, but it was a definite rebuke not just to Judge Boasberg, but to the entire D.C. Circuit Court shadow government.

But the D.C. judicial shadow government overreached itself. And Boasberg’s attempt to seize presidential powers has created a constitutional moment of crisis that may unwind the coup.

      <contentSnippet>Miami Housing Market Hit By &quot;Breathtaking&quot; Collapse In Demand

            
Nick Gerli, CEO and Founder of real estate analytics firm Reventure Consulting, has issued another troubling update on Florida&apos;s housing market—this time sounding the alarm about a collapse in demand across the Miami metro area. He described the plunge in sales as &quot;breathtaking.&quot;
For the last few years, we&apos;ve tracked the post-Covid surge in inventory hitting Sun Belt states, including this note from last summer:

Now Gerli has offered more color on the deteriorating housing market in Miami:
The collapse in demand in Miami&apos;s housing market is breathtaking. Sales are down 50% from pandemic peak, and are 30% below the long-term average for March. There&apos;s a narrative building in Florida that somehow Miami won&apos;t be impacted by this housing downturn. And that narrative is likely wrong.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A county judge in New Mexico has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abqjournal.com/news/article_47926b51-d481-4aa9-8d76-5de8cc13809b.html&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; resigned after Homeland Security Investigations agents arrested a suspected &lt;a href=&quot;https://headlineusa.com/tag/tren-de-aragua&quot;&gt;Tren de Aragua&lt;/a&gt; gang member and other illegal aliens at his home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Judge-Cano-e1745206269191.jpg?itok=_07bKoM3&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Judge-Cano-e1745206269191.jpg?itok=_07bKoM3&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;e9ef378a-6936-4fe0-9a53-31eec5b613f6&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;412&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Judge-Cano-e1745206269191.jpg?itok=_07bKoM3&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resignation of Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano comes after HSI agents executed a search warrant at his home on Feb. 28—arresting suspected 23-year-old gang member Cristhian Ortega-Lopez there. Agents also took an undisclosed number of other illegal immigrants into custody, and seized four firearms that he handled illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of Ortega-Lopez’s case are wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to court records, the suspected Tren de Aragua member was arrested while entering the U.S. illegally on Dec. 15, 2023. Due to overcrowded Border Patrol facilities, Ortega-Lopez was released three days later.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;This is absolutely bonkers: It looks like the judge&apos;s wife disclosed that the Tren de Aragua member was living with them -- and she seemingly discloses multiples crimes, including that he worked illegally and crossed the border 5 times in recent months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The judge&apos;s family might… &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/nLnbo55oFD&quot;&gt;https://t.co/nLnbo55oFD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/rnRvRadly7&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/rnRvRadly7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ortega-Lopez was supposed to stay in Denver pending removal proceedings. However, he moved to El Paso, Texas, without informing Homeland Security or any other government agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was in El Paso where Ortega-Lopez met Nancy Cano, the wife of Judge Cano.&lt;/strong&gt; The Canos admitted they hired Ortega-Lopez to install a glass door for them—which is illegal since the Venezuelan was not authorized to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ortega-Lopez was evicted from his apartment last April, after which he moved in with the Canos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The suspected Tren de Aragua member’s relationship with the Canos became cozy, so much so that he was introduced to their daughter, April Cano, who let him use her guns—which, like him working without authorization, is illegal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for the Canos, Ortega-Lopez posted pictures of himself with those firearms on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story became arguably even stranger after the HSI agents executed the Feb. 28 search warrant. On March 13, Nancy Cano wrote to U.S. Judge Damian Martinez, pleading for him to have mercy on Ortega-Lopez. In that letter, Cano seemingly admits that she illegally hired the immigrant—and also hired him out to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Each job he got I was told he did an excellent job. No one was ever disappointed. I started to receive more requests for him to return or referral for more jobs,” she said, also enclosing pictures of Ortega-Lopez with the Cano family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“On five different occasions he went through Border Patrol check points with no problems,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;she added—perhaps disclosing yet more crimes. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I took him in as my own son … Please consider his future and give him a chance.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a court hearing the next day, U.S. Judge Damian Martinez asked Justice Department prosecutor Maria Armijio if she knew Judge Cano. When the prosecutor said she didn’t know Judge Cano, Martinez said he did know him—and trusted him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve met him before several times and he’s got a BS meter like you – a lot of people have never seen. He knows when somebody is BS’ing him,” Judge Martinez said. “I don’t think Judge Cano has a BS meter and I don’t think he would just let anybody live in his property.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Martinez found that Ortega-Lopez was not a flight risk, and ordered him to be released. The DOJ appealed on March 28, disclosing more information about Ortega-Lopez’s relationship with the Canos, as well as his affiliation with Tren de Aragua. &lt;/strong&gt;According to the DOJ, agents found ample evidence of his gang affiliation while searching his cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A search of the cellphones revealed the following, which affirms the fact that the Defendant is a TdA member: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;(1) A conversation with an individual on April 30, 2024, in which he refers to his AK-47 tattoo as an ‘Aragua train,’ and comments that he is worried about telling [Nancy Cano] about it,” the DOJ said in its March 28 appeal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“(2) A conversation with an individual in which they discuss the $5,000 award offered by the State of Texas for TdA members and joke about the reward money,” the DOJ’s appeal added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“(3) A conversation with an individual in which the other participant warns Defendant about sending photographs that may jeopardize him in the United States that also includes a request to get a grenade or two 38s.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agents also allegedly found photographs of two brutal murder victims that includes mutilated bodies, decapitated heads and dismembered hands on Ortega-Lopez’s cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hearing is schedule for April 30 for Judge Martinez to reconsider allowing Ortega-Lopez to remain free on bail. The Canos have reportedly declined to comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Democrat Judge Caught Harboring Suspected Tren de Aragua Gang Member

            
Authored by Ken Silva via Headline USA,
A county judge in New Mexico has reportedly resigned after Homeland Security Investigations agents arrested a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member and other illegal aliens at his home.



The resignation of Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano comes after HSI agents executed a search warrant at his home on Feb. 28—arresting suspected 23-year-old gang member Cristhian Ortega-Lopez there. Agents also took an undisclosed number of other illegal immigrants into custody, and seized four firearms that he handled illegally.
The details of Ortega-Lopez’s case are wild.
According to court records, the suspected Tren de Aragua member was arrested while entering the U.S. illegally on Dec. 15, 2023. Due to overcrowded Border Patrol facilities, Ortega-Lopez was released three days later.
This is absolutely bonkers: It looks like the judge&apos;s wife disclosed that the Tren de Aragua member was living with them -- and she seemingly discloses multiples crimes, including that he worked illegally and crossed the border 5 times in recent months

The judge&apos;s family might… https://t.co/nLnbo55oFD pic.twitter.com/rnRvRadly7
April 21, 2025

Ortega-Lopez was supposed to stay in Denver pending removal proceedings. However, he moved to El Paso, Texas, without informing Homeland Security or any other government agency.
It was in El Paso where Ortega-Lopez met Nancy Cano, the wife of Judge Cano. The Canos admitted they hired Ortega-Lopez to install a glass door for them—which is illegal since the Venezuelan was not authorized to work.
Ortega-Lopez was evicted from his apartment last April, after which he moved in with the Canos.
The suspected Tren de Aragua member’s relationship with the Canos became cozy, so much so that he was introduced to their daughter, April Cano, who let him use her guns—which, like him working without authorization, is illegal.
Unfortunately for the Canos, Ortega-Lopez posted pictures of himself with those firearms on social media.
The story became arguably even stranger after the HSI agents executed the Feb. 28 search warrant. On March 13, Nancy Cano wrote to U.S. Judge Damian Martinez, pleading for him to have mercy on Ortega-Lopez. In that letter, Cano seemingly admits that she illegally hired the immigrant—and also hired him out to others.
“Each job he got I was told he did an excellent job. No one was ever disappointed. I started to receive more requests for him to return or referral for more jobs,” she said, also enclosing pictures of Ortega-Lopez with the Cano family.
“On five different occasions he went through Border Patrol check points with no problems,” she added—perhaps disclosing yet more crimes. “I took him in as my own son … Please consider his future and give him a chance.”
During a court hearing the next day, U.S. Judge Damian Martinez asked Justice Department prosecutor Maria Armijio if she knew Judge Cano. When the prosecutor said she didn’t know Judge Cano, Martinez said he did know him—and trusted him.



“I’ve met him before several times and he’s got a BS meter like you – a lot of people have never seen. He knows when somebody is BS’ing him,” Judge Martinez said. “I don’t think Judge Cano has a BS meter and I don’t think he would just let anybody live in his property.”
Judge Martinez found that Ortega-Lopez was not a flight risk, and ordered him to be released. The DOJ appealed on March 28, disclosing more information about Ortega-Lopez’s relationship with the Canos, as well as his affiliation with Tren de Aragua. According to the DOJ, agents found ample evidence of his gang affiliation while searching his cell phones.
“A search of the cellphones revealed the following, which affirms the fact that the Defendant is a TdA member: 
&quot;(1) A conversation with an individual on April 30, 2024, in which he refers to his AK-47 tattoo as an ‘Aragua train,’ and comments that he is worried about telling [Nancy Cano] about it,” the DOJ said in its March 28 appeal.
“(2) A conversation with an individual in which they discuss the $5,000 award offered by the State of Texas for TdA members and joke about the reward money,” the DOJ’s appeal added.
“(3) A conversation with an individual in which the other participant warns Defendant about sending photographs that may jeopardize him in the United States that also includes a request to get a grenade or two 38s.”
Agents also allegedly found photographs of two brutal murder victims that includes mutilated bodies, decapitated heads and dismembered hands on Ortega-Lopez’s cell phones.
A hearing is schedule for April 30 for Judge Martinez to reconsider allowing Ortega-Lopez to remain free on bail. The Canos have reportedly declined to comment on the matter.

&lt;p&gt;Bukele has agreed to hold deportees from the US in a maximum-security prison known as CECOT in exchange for payment - currently reported at around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-human-rights-law-likely-violated-6m-payment-el-salvador-prison-experts-say&quot;&gt;$6 million&lt;/a&gt; and growing. The Trump administration on March 15 sent 261 suspected illegal alien gang members to CECOT under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and has sent roughly 30 more since then, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration alleges that the deported Venezuelan illegals belong to criminal gangs, including Tren de Aragua, which he deemed a terrorist organization earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Bukele &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/nayibbukele/status/1914070199659098258&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on X that the 252 Venezuelans could be sent to Venezuela in exchange for the same number of &quot;political prisoners&quot; held by the Maduro government under a &quot;humanitarian agreement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Your political prisoners haven’t committed any crime,&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Nicolas Maduro, you have said on numerous occasions that you want the Venezuelans back and free,&quot; reads the post. &quot;Unlike you, who have political prisoners, we don&apos;t have political prisoners. All the Venezuelans we have in custody were detained as part of an operation against gangs like the Tren de Aragua in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unlike our detainees, many of whom have committed murder, others have committed rape, and some have even been arrested multiple times before being deported, &lt;strong&gt;your political prisoners have committed no crime. The only reason they are imprisoned is because they opposed you and your electoral fraud.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that includes &lt;strong&gt;the repatriation of 100% of the 252 Venezuelans&lt;/strong&gt; who were deported, in exchange for the release and delivery of an identical number (252) of the thousands of political prisoners that you hold,&quot; Bukele continued (translated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Maduro accepts the deal, it could ease political pressure on the Trump administration, which has been accused of denying due process to illegals and was temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court on Saturday from further deportations under the 18th century law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal comes after &lt;strong&gt;US Democrats dropped everything to demand the return of a &apos;wrongly deported&apos; El Salvadoran national living in the US illegally, Kilmar Abrego Garcia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garcia, whose wife issued a restraining order for domestic violence, was issued a deportation order and was later given a &quot;withholding of removal&quot; status due to danger he faced from a &apos;rival gang&apos; if he returned to El Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador after Bukele refused to cooperate with an order by the US Supreme Court instructing the Trump administration to &quot;facilitate&quot; the return of Abrego Garcia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Venezuelan rights group Foro Penal, there are 903 political prisoners being held by Maduro, including protesters and opposition leaders. Among the political prisoners Bukele mentioned is the son-in-law of former diplomat Edmundo González, who ran against Maduro and is considered by some allies of Washington to have won the election. Also being held by Maduro are journalist Roland Carreño, and the mother of opposition leader María Corina Machado.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>El Salvador Offers To Swap Venezuelans Deported From US For Political Prisoners Held By Venezuela

            
El Salvaror&apos;s President Nayib Bukele has offered to swap 252 Venezuelans deported to his country for &quot;political prisoners&quot; held by Venezuela.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;China&apos;s Oil Supertankers Slammed With $5.2 Million Fee Per U.S. Port Call&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Chinas-Oil-Supertankers-Face-52-Million-Fee-per-US-Port-Call.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Charles Kennedy via OilPrice.com,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The U.S. is introducing fees on operators of China-built vessels calling at U.S. ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These fees could reach up to $5.2 million per call for large supertankers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The U.S. Trade Representative states the move aims to address Chinese dominance and bolster the U.S. shipbuilding industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The U.S. move to penalize China-built and China-owned vessels calling at U.S. ports&lt;/strong&gt; could lead to an oil supertanker made in China and operated by a Chinese company facing a fee of up to $5.2 million per call at a U.S. port, shipbrokers have estimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://ustr.gov/about/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2025/april/ustr-section-301-action-chinas-targeting-maritime-logistics-and-shipbuilding-sectors-dominance&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; fees on vessel owners and operators of China based on net tonnage per U.S. voyage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous proposal was a per-port-entry fee of up to $1.5 million on Chinese-built vessels, and up to a $1 million per-port-entry fee on any vessel (Chinese-built or non-Chinese-built) for operators that have any Chinese-built vessels in their fleet or orderbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) plans to impose fees on operators of Chinese-built ships based on net tonnage or containers, increasing incrementally over the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the new USTR move, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said, “Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The Trump administration’s actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the U.S. supply chain, and send a demand signal for U.S.-built ships,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Greer added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the new plan, the fee on a China-made China-operated supertanker could reach up to $5.2 million per call because of the large tonnage of the supertankers compared to smaller oil tankers, according to the research arm of Arrow Shipbroking Group cited by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-21/china-owned-supertankers-face-5-2-million-in-fees-per-us-call?embedded-checkout=true&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The previous per-call only fee would have charged up to $3.5 million for a tanker to call at a U.S. port.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil traders have already started to &lt;a href=&quot;https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Traders-Shun-Chinese-Tankers-as-Trump-Prepares-Port-Fees.html&quot;&gt;avoid hiring tankers&lt;/a&gt; built in China amid concerns that port fees could be coming for Chinese vessels at U.S. ports as part of a plan by President Donald Trump to revitalize the American shipbuilding industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oil traders and charterers that are booking vessels to call, load, or discharge cargoes at U.S. ports are seeking vessels not built in China, &lt;/strong&gt;market sources told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-03/oil-traders-shun-china-made-ships-for-us-flows-on-trump-levies&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>China&apos;s Oil Supertankers Slammed With $5.2 Million Fee Per U.S. Port Call

            
Authored by Charles Kennedy via OilPrice.com,

	
The U.S. is introducing fees on operators of China-built vessels calling at U.S. ports.
These fees could reach up to $5.2 million per call for large supertankers.
The U.S. Trade Representative states the move aims to address Chinese dominance and bolster the U.S. shipbuilding industry.
The U.S. move to penalize China-built and China-owned vessels calling at U.S. ports could lead to an oil supertanker made in China and operated by a Chinese company facing a fee of up to $5.2 million per call at a U.S. port, shipbrokers have estimated.



The U.S. last week announced fees on vessel owners and operators of China based on net tonnage per U.S. voyage. 
The previous proposal was a per-port-entry fee of up to $1.5 million on Chinese-built vessels, and up to a $1 million per-port-entry fee on any vessel (Chinese-built or non-Chinese-built) for operators that have any Chinese-built vessels in their fleet or orderbook.
Now, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) plans to impose fees on operators of Chinese-built ships based on net tonnage or containers, increasing incrementally over the following years.

&lt;p&gt;With gold surging through $3420/oz. for the first time ever this morning, many are pointing back to one of President Trump&apos;s Truth Social posts from yesterday. Trump wrote on Easter: &quot;THE GOLDEN RULE OF NEGOTIATING AND SUCCESS: HE WHO HAS THE GOLD MAKES THE RULES. THANK YOU!&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall, in early 2025, Donald Trump and Elon Musk publicly questioned whether Fort Knox still holds its gold reserves. Trump announced plans to visit the site, while Musk suggested a live-streamed inspection, saying, “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20at%209.26.51%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?itok=9KuQfSdy&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20at%209.26.51%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?itok=9KuQfSdy&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;8bf0f10d-ccb0-4984-9240-fc8b4e4480f0&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;187&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20at%209.26.51%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?itok=9KuQfSdy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent then responded by citing a 2024 audit confirming the presence of 147.3 million ounces of gold, with no major withdrawals in years. He added that senators can request a tour through his office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we&apos;ve laid out a number of reasons we think gold is surging in our article out this morning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/market-recaps/us-stock-futures-dollar-treasuries-tumble-powell-punt-panic-gold-bitcoin-soar&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;in a sign that investors are rotating investments away from the US, Deutsche Bank AG said that Chinese clients have reduced some of their Treasuries holdings in favor of European debt. European high-quality bonds, Japanese government bonds and gold are likely to be the potential choices for investors as alternatives to Treasuries, said Lillian Tao, head of China macro and global emerging market sales at the bank,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/market-recaps/us-stock-futures-dollar-treasuries-tumble-powell-punt-panic-gold-bitcoin-soar&quot;&gt;we wrote earlier this morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there was no specific catalyst for the suddenly collapse in the illiquid early Asian session, which saw many countries on extended Easter holiday, Bloomberg quoted traders that hedge funds are selling the dollar against virtually any currencies after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that President Donald Trump is still exploring ways to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The president and his team will continue to study that,” National Economic Council Director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-18/trump-studying-whether-removing-powell-is-option-hassett-says&quot;&gt;Kevin Hassett said Friday&lt;/a&gt; when asked by a reporter if removing Powell was an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hassett then suggested, accurately, that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The policy of this Federal Reserve was to raise rates the minute President Trump was elected last time, to say that the supply-side tax cuts that were going to be inflationary,” Hassett said, adding that Fed officials opted not to go “on TV and at IMF meetings and warn about the terrible inflation from the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden, and the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden was textbook inflationary,” Hassett continued. “And then they cut rates right ahead of the election.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;El Salvador Works With Nvidia To Develop Sovereign AI Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador, the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is working with the computer chip giant Nvidia to implement artificial intelligence for national development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/01965898-0653-777c-a4b5-3648b42e.jpg?itok=dCzvLDNk&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/01965898-0653-777c-a4b5-3648b42e.jpg?itok=dCzvLDNk&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;50481545-f7b0-4690-baea-c5a3952e71d1&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/01965898-0653-777c-a4b5-3648b42e.jpg?itok=dCzvLDNk&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador signed a letter of intent to collaborate with Nvidia on “sovereign AI to drive innovation and economic growth,” the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) of El Salvador &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/bitcoinofficesv/status/1914288066056904796&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on X on April 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the collaboration, El Salvador will benefit from Nvidia’s AI tools, resources and expertise, enabling the development of sovereign AI capabilities targeting priorities related to culture, language, environment and economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“El Salvador will focus on building domestic AI infrastructure, upskilling the workforce, and creating solutions to address local challenges such as improving healthcare delivery, advancing education, and boosting economic productivity,” the announcement said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AI training for state officials and developers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador’s latest collaboration with Nvidia marks the country’s commitment to encouraging AI usage to optimize multiple processes within the government and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its new AI push, El Salvador intends to establish AI training programs for developers, researchers and government officials to “ensure the nation has the talent to sustain its AI ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>El Salvador Works With Nvidia To Develop Sovereign AI Infrastructure

            
Authored by Helen Partz via CoinTelegraph.com,
El Salvador, the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is working with the computer chip giant Nvidia to implement artificial intelligence for national development.



El Salvador signed a letter of intent to collaborate with Nvidia on “sovereign AI to drive innovation and economic growth,” the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) of El Salvador announced on X on April 21.
As part of the collaboration, El Salvador will benefit from Nvidia’s AI tools, resources and expertise, enabling the development of sovereign AI capabilities targeting priorities related to culture, language, environment and economy.
“El Salvador will focus on building domestic AI infrastructure, upskilling the workforce, and creating solutions to address local challenges such as improving healthcare delivery, advancing education, and boosting economic productivity,” the announcement said.
AI training for state officials and developers
El Salvador’s latest collaboration with Nvidia marks the country’s commitment to encouraging AI usage to optimize multiple processes within the government and society.
With its new AI push, El Salvador intends to establish AI training programs for developers, researchers and government officials to “ensure the nation has the talent to sustain its AI ambitions.”

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has confirmed the end of its 30-hour Easter truce, which reportedly had some success as areas across the frontlines saw &lt;strong&gt;guns and shelling fall silent &lt;/strong&gt;for the first time in well over three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday the Kremlin acknowledged that &lt;strong&gt;military action has resumed&lt;/strong&gt;, and also emphasized again that the ceasefire which began Saturday evening was indicative of its attitude that it is indeed open to any peace initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Our attitude to ceasefires is positive&lt;/strong&gt;, and that is why we proposed the initiative, especially as it was during the holy Easter days,&quot; Putin had said of the special holiday weekend truce. &quot;We’ve seen the initial reaction [from Kiev], as I believe everyone did. The statement characterized our proposal as ‘playing with lives’ and so on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/eastertruce.jpg?itok=XZO5bIqT&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/eastertruce.jpg?itok=XZO5bIqT&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;f745922a-5b7e-4d6e-a973-46bfdea7d716&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/eastertruce.jpg?itok=XZO5bIqT&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Via Al Jazeera footage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky had quickly accused Putin of not being genuine, and suggested it was a PR move intended to signal the Trump administration. &quot;As of Easter morning, we can say that the Russian army is trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places, it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine,&quot; he had posted on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are &lt;strong&gt;only interested in favorable PR coverage&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; Zelensky wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Putin had pointed out, &quot;Apparently, smarter people – probably foreign handlers – explained that refusing such a proposal is a losing proposition for the Kiev regime, and [the Ukrainians] swiftly agreed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has also shot back in fresh Monday statements that Zelensky was &lt;strong&gt;&quot;ready to reject Easter ceasefire — until his Western curators reminded him it&apos;s bad PR to oppose peace outright.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has meanwhile &lt;strong&gt;proposed extending the truce for 30 days&lt;/strong&gt; after it ended midnight Sunday, resulting in the Kremlin saying it is studying the possibility. Putin has since said he is &lt;strong&gt;reviewing a Ukrainian proposal for each side to case attacks on any civilian infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Putin has made clear that he&apos;s not interested in a merely temporary solution, but wants to achieve something lasing, on fears that Ukraine would just use a 30-day window to rearm and regroup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russian state media has published footage showing that during the Easter truce there was &lt;strong&gt;some positive, peaceful engagement among some troops on the ground&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Divisions Remain As Republicans Steam Ahead With &apos;Big Beautiful Bill&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/divisions-remain-as-republicans-steam-ahead-with-big-beautiful-bill-what-to-know-5844985?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Jackson Richman, Arjun Singh, and Joseph Lord via The Epoch Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Republicans barrel full steam ahead with President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” several divisions over components of the package linger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2896%29_5.jpg?itok=HR6qv6Ln&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2896%29_5.jpg?itok=HR6qv6Ln&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;3062b4a1-329e-489f-84ea-45af3dfefa24&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2896%29_5.jpg?itok=HR6qv6Ln&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, both chambers approved a budget blueprint that resulted from weeks of negotiations between the House and Senate, unlocking the reconciliation process being used to pass the package. In the coming weeks, the difficult work of passing Trump’s legislative agenda begins in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dubbed the “one, big, beautiful bill” by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), it is expected to consist of measures related to tax cuts, America’s energy sector, and securing the border.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reconciliation bill, it would be immune from the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate—but only if House Republicans can agree on a package first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Republicans’ narrow majority in the lower chamber—&lt;strong&gt;Johnson can spare no more than three defections&lt;/strong&gt;—passing this package will be a herculean task for leadership. Johnson will need to keep both moderates and conservatives happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about the lingering disputes as Republicans move forward with drafting the text of their bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Border Security, Energy, and Defense&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core components of the Republican budget proposal unveiled by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)—bolstering border security, funding energy expansion, and new defense appropriations—are generally non-controversial with broad swaths of Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In line with his chief policy priority during the 2024 presidential election, Trump and Republicans have sought to implement sweeping changes to how immigration and border security are handled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That includes both ongoing efforts to stem the flow of illegal immigrants across the U.S. southern border with Mexico and what Trump has promised will be the “largest deportation operation in American history.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding will target increased deportation-related detentions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Immigration Court hearings, and removal operations. Beyond removals, the Trump administration is pursuing the finalized construction of a border wall between the United States and Mexico, Trump’s main campaign promise in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has told The Epoch Times that he seeks to have his state “reimbursed” for its ongoing border security efforts under “Operation Lone Star” run by Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Texas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“[I want some] reimbursing [of] the State of Texas for the billions they’ve spent dealing with Joe Biden and the Democrats’ failure to secure the border,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Cruz told The Epoch Times on March 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the package will include new funding for energy and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump and his allies have been outspoken about their support of enhancing U.S. drilling, fracking, and natural gas extraction. During the 2024 election, Trump summarized his position as “Drill, baby, drill.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s argued that new and renewable energy sources should be used alongside traditional fossil fuel-based infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While policy changes in a reconciliation bill are restricted under the rules of the process, Republicans are sure to pursue an increase in energy production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current budget blueprint additionally instructs the House and Senate to allocate an additional $100 billion and $150 billion, respectively, toward defense over a decade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aspects of the bill are among the least controversial with Republicans. Some other components will be a tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tax Cuts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centerpiece of the Senate’s budget blueprint, which has since been approved by the House, is its plan to make permanent the personal income tax cuts first authorized by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The GOP proposal comes out to a top-line cost of around $4.5 trillion in lost potential tax revenue for the government.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without congressional action, those cuts will expire at the end of 2025 and rates will increase—a potential political nightmare for Republicans at the ballot box in 2026 if the issue isn’t addressed before Tax Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to implement these new rates permanently, Republicans must comply with the Byrd Rule, a rule governing the reconciliation process, which requires that any policy that impacts the deficit beyond ten years must be sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This could face challenges in both the House and Senate, however. Without steep spending cuts alongside these tax cuts, critics fear that the deficit could balloon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lower chamber, many lawmakers—such as budget hawks like Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), and members of the House Freedom Caucus—have expressed these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the House budget instructions currently call for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts—already a difficult ask—conservatives have indicated they won’t support any package that comes in at less than $2 trillion in cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But such steep cuts could equally alienate the moderate wing of the GOP: members like Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) and fellow purple district Republicans in California and New York have sought assurance that these spending cuts won’t harm key entitlements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threading the needle between these competing impulses will be challenging for leadership.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Medicaid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The budget resolution instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to cut $880 billion in spending over a decade, an amount that critics suspect will result in reductions to Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is Democrats’ main rallying point against the proposal, with several arguing that Republicans are planning to “gut Medicaid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson has said there will be no substantive cuts, but will only target waste, fraud, and abuse in the program. Trump has also expressed clear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/fact-check-president-trump-will-always-protect-social-security-medicare/&quot;&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt; to making any substantive cuts to the entitlement program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There are a lot of Americans who rely upon those—those programs, and we’ve got to ensure that they’re safeguarded,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; said Johnson on Fox News on April 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Johnson argued that there’s abuse in the program that can be rooted out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you have people on the program that are draining the resources, it takes it away from the people that are actually needing it the most and are intended to receive it. You’re talking about young single mothers down on their fortunes at the moment, the people with the real disabilities, the elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least 12 Republicans have come out against Medicaid cuts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Balancing the federal budget must not come at the expense of those who depend on these benefits for their health and economic security,” they wrote in an April 14 letter to Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Debt Ceiling Increase&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The budget resolution also calls for the House to increase the nation’s borrowing limit by $4 trillion and the Senate by $5 trillion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Divisions Remain As Republicans Steam Ahead With &apos;Big Beautiful Bill&apos;

            
Authored by Jackson Richman, Arjun Singh, and Joseph Lord via The Epoch Times,
As Republicans barrel full steam ahead with President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” several divisions over components of the package linger.



Earlier this month, both chambers approved a budget blueprint that resulted from weeks of negotiations between the House and Senate, unlocking the reconciliation process being used to pass the package. In the coming weeks, the difficult work of passing Trump’s legislative agenda begins in earnest.
Dubbed the “one, big, beautiful bill” by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), it is expected to consist of measures related to tax cuts, America’s energy sector, and securing the border.
As a reconciliation bill, it would be immune from the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate—but only if House Republicans can agree on a package first.
Given Republicans’ narrow majority in the lower chamber—Johnson can spare no more than three defections—passing this package will be a herculean task for leadership. Johnson will need to keep both moderates and conservatives happy.
Here’s what to know about the lingering disputes as Republicans move forward with drafting the text of their bill.
Border Security, Energy, and Defense
The core components of the Republican budget proposal unveiled by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)—bolstering border security, funding energy expansion, and new defense appropriations—are generally non-controversial with broad swaths of Republicans.
In line with his chief policy priority during the 2024 presidential election, Trump and Republicans have sought to implement sweeping changes to how immigration and border security are handled.
That includes both ongoing efforts to stem the flow of illegal immigrants across the U.S. southern border with Mexico and what Trump has promised will be the “largest deportation operation in American history.”
Funding will target increased deportation-related detentions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Immigration Court hearings, and removal operations. Beyond removals, the Trump administration is pursuing the finalized construction of a border wall between the United States and Mexico, Trump’s main campaign promise in 2016.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has told The Epoch Times that he seeks to have his state “reimbursed” for its ongoing border security efforts under “Operation Lone Star” run by Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Texas).
“[I want some] reimbursing [of] the State of Texas for the billions they’ve spent dealing with Joe Biden and the Democrats’ failure to secure the border,” Cruz told The Epoch Times on March 31.
Additionally, the package will include new funding for energy and defense.
Trump and his allies have been outspoken about their support of enhancing U.S. drilling, fracking, and natural gas extraction. During the 2024 election, Trump summarized his position as “Drill, baby, drill.”
He’s argued that new and renewable energy sources should be used alongside traditional fossil fuel-based infrastructure.
While policy changes in a reconciliation bill are restricted under the rules of the process, Republicans are sure to pursue an increase in energy production.
The current budget blueprint additionally instructs the House and Senate to allocate an additional $100 billion and $150 billion, respectively, toward defense over a decade.
These aspects of the bill are among the least controversial with Republicans. Some other components will be a tougher sell.
Tax Cuts
The centerpiece of the Senate’s budget blueprint, which has since been approved by the House, is its plan to make permanent the personal income tax cuts first authorized by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
The GOP proposal comes out to a top-line cost of around $4.5 trillion in lost potential tax revenue for the government.
Without congressional action, those cuts will expire at the end of 2025 and rates will increase—a potential political nightmare for Republicans at the ballot box in 2026 if the issue isn’t addressed before Tax Day.
In order to implement these new rates permanently, Republicans must comply with the Byrd Rule, a rule governing the reconciliation process, which requires that any policy that impacts the deficit beyond ten years must be sunset.
This could face challenges in both the House and Senate, however. Without steep spending cuts alongside these tax cuts, critics fear that the deficit could balloon.
In the lower chamber, many lawmakers—such as budget hawks like Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), and members of the House Freedom Caucus—have expressed these concerns.
While the House budget instructions currently call for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts—already a difficult ask—conservatives have indicated they won’t support any package that comes in at less than $2 trillion in cuts.
But such steep cuts could equally alienate the moderate wing of the GOP: members like Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) and fellow purple district Republicans in California and New York have sought assurance that these spending cuts won’t harm key entitlements.
Threading the needle between these competing impulses will be challenging for leadership.
Medicaid
The budget resolution instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to cut $880 billion in spending over a decade, an amount that critics suspect will result in reductions to Medicaid.
The issue is Democrats’ main rallying point against the proposal, with several arguing that Republicans are planning to “gut Medicaid.”
Johnson has said there will be no substantive cuts, but will only target waste, fraud, and abuse in the program. Trump has also expressed clear opposition to making any substantive cuts to the entitlement program.
“There are a lot of Americans who rely upon those—those programs, and we’ve got to ensure that they’re safeguarded,” said Johnson on Fox News on April 13.
But Johnson argued that there’s abuse in the program that can be rooted out.
“When you have people on the program that are draining the resources, it takes it away from the people that are actually needing it the most and are intended to receive it. You’re talking about young single mothers down on their fortunes at the moment, the people with the real disabilities, the elderly.”
At least 12 Republicans have come out against Medicaid cuts.
“Balancing the federal budget must not come at the expense of those who depend on these benefits for their health and economic security,” they wrote in an April 14 letter to Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.).
Debt Ceiling Increase
The budget resolution also calls for the House to increase the nation’s borrowing limit by $4 trillion and the Senate by $5 trillion.
The Senate figure has come under fire by conservatives in the House such as members of the Freedom Caucus. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) initially told The Epoch Times that the budget resolution was “DEAD ON ARRIVAL” in the House, though he eventually voted for it.
The debt ceiling is set to be reached within the next few months, though the exact timing is uncertain. Were the limit to not be lifted, the United States could go into default for the fifth time in its history.
The debt limit has usually been increased on a bipartisan basis as it last was in 2023. However, by raising it without Democrat support, the GOP is looking to do so by pairing it with significant fiscal measures.
Ultimately, the issue could still divide the two chambers, as the Senate seeks a greater debt limit bump than many House conservatives can stomach in the final package.

&lt;p&gt;“The US LEI for March pointed to slowing economic activity ahead,” said Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, Senior Manager, Business Cycle Indicators, at The Conference Board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still, the Conference Board downwardly revised our US GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 1.6%, which is somewhat below the economy’s potential. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The slower projected growth rate reflects the impact of deepening trade wars, which may result in higher inflation, supply chain disruptions, less investing and spending, and a weaker labor market.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LEI’s six-month growth rate ticked down in March, but &lt;strong&gt;remained well above the recession threshold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the economy is doomed (ish) because stocks and sentiment are down... because investors are pricing in a doomed economy...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perhaps the word &apos;leading&apos; in this index is misleading...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Sentiment &amp; Stock Prices Spark Biggest Plunge In US Leading Economic Indicators In 17 Months

            
Since December&apos;s Trump-optimism-driven surge in Leading Economic Indicators (the first since last February), The Conference Board&apos;s headline index has decelerated rapidly with March data released today plunging 0.7% MoM - the biggest drop since October 2023...



Consumer Sentiment and Stock Prices were the biggest negative contributors, while Building Permits and Jobless Claims were the biggest positive contributors...



That dragged the total index level down to its lowest since October 2016...



“The US LEI for March pointed to slowing economic activity ahead,” said Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, Senior Manager, Business Cycle Indicators, at The Conference Board.
&quot;That said, the data does not suggest that a recession has begun or is about to start. 
Still, the Conference Board downwardly revised our US GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 1.6%, which is somewhat below the economy’s potential. 
The slower projected growth rate reflects the impact of deepening trade wars, which may result in higher inflation, supply chain disruptions, less investing and spending, and a weaker labor market.&quot;
The LEI’s six-month growth rate ticked down in March, but remained well above the recession threshold



So the economy is doomed (ish) because stocks and sentiment are down... because investors are pricing in a doomed economy...?

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key data release this week is be the &lt;strong&gt;global flash PMIs &lt;/strong&gt;for April on Wednesday.

In corporate earnings, highlights include &lt;strong&gt;Alphabet, Tesla and SAP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a closer look: &lt;strong&gt;the highlight in economic data be the April flash PMIs for the key economies due Wednesday. &lt;/strong&gt;The impact of US tariffs will be the main focus, especially for European manufacturing gauges, which have been recovering in recent months. Among G7 countries, &lt;strong&gt;the manufacturing index was slightly above 50 (50.2) only in the US.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other notable economic indicators out next week include &lt;strong&gt;March durable goods orders and housing market data in the US. &lt;/strong&gt;DB economists see durable goods orders (Thursday) growth at +0.5% MoM (+1.0% in February). The Fed will also release its Beige Book on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, several other sentiment gauges are due, including &lt;strong&gt;the Ifo survey in Germany (Thursday) as well as consumer confidence indicators in the UK (Friday), the Eurozone (Tuesday) and France (Thursday).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Asia, the focus in Japan will be on &lt;strong&gt;the Tokyo CPI for April out on Friday. &lt;/strong&gt;1-yr and 5-yr loan rates fixings are due in China on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from economic data, &lt;strong&gt;notable events next week include the 2025 Spring Meetings of the World Bank and the IMF on April 21-26, in Washington, D.C. &lt;/strong&gt;The IMF will release its full World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability reports on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rounding out with corporate earnings, the spotlight next week will be on Alphabet (Thursday) and Tesla (Tuesday). Other tech reports due include Intel, IBM and ServiceNow. The focus will also be on consumer firms such as P&amp;G, PepsiCo and Chipotle. Key US defence firms RTX, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman will release earnings on Tuesday. In Europe, names to watch include SAP and Dassault Systemes.&lt;/p&gt;

On April 11, Goolsbee said, “It makes the Fed’s job harder if you get what is clearly a stagflationary shock. When both sides of our mandate start getting worse at the same time, there’s not a generic playbook that you turn to.” He also added, “How we respond to a stagflationary shock depends on which one’s worse, how long are they going to last, are higher prices transitory or permanent, on the growth side, is this a response to uncertainty or is this spiraling more into recession.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, April 22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Speech text is expected. On April 3, Jefferson said, “Labor market conditions have remained stable through February, and progress on inflation has eased, but the outlook is uncertain.” He also added, “These conditions led me to favor holding the policy rate constant at what I view as a moderately restrictive level.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09:30 AM Philadelphia Fed President Harker (FOMC non-voter) speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Philadelphia Fed President Patric Harker will participate in a fireside chat about how economic mobility impacts regional economies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;01:30 PM Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari (FOMC non-voter) speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari will participate in a moderated discussion at the US Chamber of Commerce Global Summit in Washington DC. Q&amp;A is expected. On March 26, Kashkari said, “It’s conceivable that the hit to confidence could be a bigger effect than the tariffs themselves, and that makes me nervous, but the good news is the hit to confidence could be restored quickly if there are resolutions of these trade uncertainties.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;02:30 PM Richmond Fed President Barkin (FOMC non-voter) speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will participate in a fireside chat at the RVA Big Dipper Innovation Summit in Richmond, Virginia. Q&amp;A is expected. On April 1, Barkin said, “So far, the tariffs that have been announced have been revised. I plan to give it some time to see if we can figure out what a stable policy regime is [for tariffs] and then we can start thinking more about monetary policy.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;04:00 PM Fed Governor Kugler speaks:&lt;/strong&gt; Fed Governor Adriana Kugler will speak on the transmission of monetary policy at the University of Minnesota School of Public Affairs. Q&amp;A is expected. On April 2, Kugler said, “Given the recent lack of progress on inflation, recent increases in inflation expectations, and upside risks associated with announced and prospective policy changes… I will support maintaining the current policy rate for as long as these upside risks to inflation continue, while economic activity and employment remain stable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, April 23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fed Governor Kugler speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Fed Governor Adriana Kugler will attend and give brief introductory remarks at a Mille Lacs tribal meeting. The exact meeting time is TBD.&lt;/li&gt;

On April 11, Musalem said, “Changes in tariffs can have various direct and indirect effects on prices and economic activity, depending on how they are implemented and the extent of retaliation by trading partners.” He also noted, “The direct effects might have only a brief and limited impact on inflation, [but] indirect and second-round effects could have a more persistent impact.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09:35 AM Fed Governor Waller speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Fed Governor Christopher Waller will give opening remarks at a Fed Listens event. On April 14, Waller said, “With large tariff increases, I would expect the U.S. economy to slow significantly later this year and this slower pace to continue into next year.” He also added, “If the slowdown is significant and even threatens a recession, then I would expect to favor cutting the FOMC&apos;s policy rate sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09:45 AM S&amp;P Global US manufacturing PMI, April preliminary (consensus 49.3, last 50.2): &lt;/strong&gt;S&amp;P Global US services PMI, April preliminary (consensus 53.0, last 54.4)&lt;/li&gt;

Speech text and Q&amp;A are expected. On April 16, Hammack said, “Given the economy’s starting point, and with both sides of our mandate expected to be under pressure, there is a strong case to hold monetary policy steady in order to balance the risks coming from further elevated inflation and a slowing labor market.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, April 24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;08:30 AM Durable goods orders, March preliminary (GS +5.0%, consensus +1.5%, last +1.0%);  Durable goods orders ex-transportation, March preliminary (GS flat, consensus +0.3%, last +0.7%); Core capital goods orders, March preliminary (GS -0.2%, consensus +0.1%, last -0.2%); Core capital goods shipments, March preliminary (GS -0.2%, consensus +0.2%, last +0.8%): &lt;/strong&gt;We estimate that durable goods orders increased 5.0% in the preliminary March report (month-over-month, seasonally adjusted), reflecting a sharp increase in commercial aircraft orders. We forecast 0.2% declines in core capital goods orders and shipments, reflecting declines in the new orders and shipments components of manufacturing surveys in March.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;08:30 AM Initial jobless claims, week ended April 19 (GS 210k, last 215k);&lt;/strong&gt; Continuing jobless claims, week ended April 12 (last 1,885k)&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Wedbush&apos;s Dan Ives Warns About &quot;Code Red&quot; Situation Unfolding At Tesla </title>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Wedbush&apos;s Dan Ives Warns About &quot;Code Red&quot; Situation Unfolding At Tesla &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just weeks after Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives slashed his Tesla price target by 43%, citing a brand crisis fueled by CEO Elon Musk&apos;s involvement with DOGE, he&apos;s back with another warning about a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;code red&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; moment for the most American-made car brand—one day before its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; Ives penned in a note to clients on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla....and anyone that thinks the brand damage Musk has inflicted is not a real thing, spend some time speaking to car buyers in the US, Europe, and Asia. You will think differently after those discussions&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Ives, whose analyst rating on the stock remains &quot;Buy&quot; rated, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/wedbushs-daniel-ives-cuts-tesla-price-target-says-brand-has-morphed-political-symbol&quot;&gt;slashed his price target&lt;/a&gt; to $315, down from $550. He explained, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally, adding, &quot;It is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the analyst, Tesla faces &quot;&lt;strong&gt;potentially 15%-20% permanent demand destruction for future Tesla buyers due to the brand damage Musk has created with DOGE. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Yet we must point out that the Tesla protests were small-scale and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/political/tesla-takedown-organizers-plan-color-revolution-kill-brand-death-spiral-investors&quot;&gt;funded by corrupt NGOs&lt;/a&gt; connected with rogue billionaires and the Democratic Party. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news for Ives is that Musk is a special government employee with DOGE, a temporary federal employee who can only work 130 days a year. There are ways around extending SGE time, but a recent report from Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said Musk is expected to step back from his hole once the 130 days lapse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ives remained bullish on Tesla, calling the brand one of the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;most disruptive technology companies on the globe over the coming years&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; Yet he said Tesla needs its &quot;most important asset&quot;: Musk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Tesla will announce its earnings for the first quarter. From a delivery perspective, we already have a good idea about weak sales—that&apos;s because it releases delivery numbers for the quarter several weeks before it releases its full results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of April, Tesla &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/tesla-deliveries-tktktktk-draft-do-not-publish&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 330,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, missing Goldman, JPM, Morgan Stanley, and UBS&apos; estimates of between 351,000 and 375,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla shares have been halved since their record high on Dec. 17.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Wedbush&apos;s Dan Ives Warns About &quot;Code Red&quot; Situation Unfolding At Tesla 

            
Just weeks after Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives slashed his Tesla price target by 43%, citing a brand crisis fueled by CEO Elon Musk&apos;s involvement with DOGE, he&apos;s back with another warning about a &quot;code red&quot; moment for the most American-made car brand—one day before its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. 
&quot;Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,&quot; Ives penned in a note to clients on Sunday. 
He said, &quot;Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla....and anyone that thinks the brand damage Musk has inflicted is not a real thing, spend some time speaking to car buyers in the US, Europe, and Asia. You will think differently after those discussions.&quot;
Two weeks ago, Ives, whose analyst rating on the stock remains &quot;Buy&quot; rated, slashed his price target to $315, down from $550. He explained, &quot;Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally, adding, &quot;It is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty.&quot;
According to the analyst, Tesla faces &quot;potentially 15%-20% permanent demand destruction for future Tesla buyers due to the brand damage Musk has created with DOGE. &quot; Yet we must point out that the Tesla protests were small-scale and funded by corrupt NGOs connected with rogue billionaires and the Democratic Party. 
The good news for Ives is that Musk is a special government employee with DOGE, a temporary federal employee who can only work 130 days a year. There are ways around extending SGE time, but a recent report from Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said Musk is expected to step back from his hole once the 130 days lapse. 
Ives remained bullish on Tesla, calling the brand one of the &quot;most disruptive technology companies on the globe over the coming years.&quot; Yet he said Tesla needs its &quot;most important asset&quot;: Musk. 
On Tuesday, Tesla will announce its earnings for the first quarter. From a delivery perspective, we already have a good idea about weak sales—that&apos;s because it releases delivery numbers for the quarter several weeks before it releases its full results. 
At the start of April, Tesla reported 330,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, missing Goldman, JPM, Morgan Stanley, and UBS&apos; estimates of between 351,000 and 375,000. 



Tesla shares have been halved since their record high on Dec. 17.



As of the latest Wall Street consensus (data via Bloomberg), 54.1% of analysts covering Tesla maintain a &quot;Buy&quot; rating, 24.6% rate the stock as &quot;Hold,&quot; and 21.3% assign a &quot;Sell&quot; rating.



Ives concluded, &quot;We view this as a fork in the road time: if Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage, but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO,&quot; adding, &quot;If Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House, it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow.&quot;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same day Pope Francis—known for his inclusive beliefs—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/pope-francis-dies-88&quot;&gt;passed away&lt;/a&gt;, another globalist fell: Klaus Schwab, the architect of the World Economic Forum&apos;s dystopian agenda, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/press/2025/04/world-economic-forum-announces-governance-transition/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; he was stepping down from the WEF board. It marks the end of an era for Schwab, who championed radical wokeness, bug eating, mass vaccination campaigns, population control, and climate de-growth policies through what often resembled digital communism—social credit scores, central bank digital currencies, and many more China-like policies. Meanwhile, cultural shifts across the Americas signal a rising movement toward traditional values, sending the WEF&apos;s ideological woke grip on governments, non-government organizations, corporations, the church, and society into disarray. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Following my recent announcement, and as I enter my 88th year, I have decided to step down from the position of Chair and as a member of the Board of Trustees, with immediate effect&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; Schwab wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/GpDLm6PXAAAJx7l.jpg?itok=XOyvofPt&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/GpDLm6PXAAAJx7l.jpg?itok=XOyvofPt&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;de6a6471-afd5-4154-a0cb-6e476561b8b1&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/GpDLm6PXAAAJx7l.jpg?itok=XOyvofPt&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwab stepped down as executive chairman one year ago (read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/wef-founder-klaus-schwab-stepping-down-executive-chairman&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), with former Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende taking over daily operations. WEF said Vice Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe was appointed board chairman in the interim and that a search committee for replacement had been appointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WEF stated: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At a time when the world is undergoing rapid transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the need for inclusive dialogue to navigate complexity and shape the future has never been more critical. The Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum underlines the importance of remaining steadfast in its mission and values as a facilitator of progress. Building on its trusted role, the Forum will continue to bring together leaders from all sectors and regions to exchange insights and foster collaboration.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might recognize some of the WEF&apos;s board members...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwab’s resignation also comes three months after President Trump told globalist CEOs at the WEF’s 2025 Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, “America is back.” It also follows Trump and Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative, which nuked USAID programs that funneled billions of taxpayer dollars into corrupt NGOs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Klaus Schwab Steps Down From WEF Board Amid Globalist Retreat

            
On the same day Pope Francis—known for his inclusive beliefs—passed away, another globalist fell: Klaus Schwab, the architect of the World Economic Forum&apos;s dystopian agenda, announced he was stepping down from the WEF board.
