      <title>Keep watching the U.S. Dollar:

As the S&amp;P 500 rises +5% in 2 days on ‚Äútariff de-escalation‚Äù headlines, the U.S. Dollar Index, $DXY, is up a mere 0.2% today.

The U.S. Dollar is just about the only asset not buying these headlines today.

Furthermore, the U.S. Dollar has been a key leading indicator of trade war sentiment.

It‚Äôs almost as though the U.S. Dollar thinks U.S. trade headlines have lost credibility.

Something is off. (From TKL)</title>

      <title>Retail investors were just cheated:

Yesterday at 12:00 PM ET, US Treasury Secretary Bessent said he sees &quot;de-escalation with China&quot; and the current situation is &quot;unsustainable.&quot;

These comments were provided at a CLOSED-DOOR investor summit hosted by JP Morgan.

This summit was not open to the public or to the media.

Then, at 5:18 PM ET, President Trump said tariffs on China &quot;will not be as high as 145%.&quot;

Bessent effectively told a closed-group of Wall Street investors that de-escalation with China was coming BEFORE the public knew.

The result was a move of +5% in S&amp;P 500 futures, for a total of +$2.2 TRILLION of market cap.

Investors at the JP Morgan event were able to front-run these headlines.

How is this fair for retail investors? (From TKL)</title>

      <title>CHINA SIGNALS OPENNESS TO U.S. TRADE TALKS, WARNS AGAINST THREATS

China expressed willingness to resume trade talks with the U.S., a day after President Trump suggested cutting tariffs on Chinese goods. However, Beijing warned it won‚Äôt negotiate under continued threats.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want a trade war, but we‚Äôre not afraid of one,‚Äù said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun. ‚ÄúIf we talk, the door is open.‚Äù

Both sides appear to be softening their stance. Trump said he‚Äôs not playing ‚Äúhardball‚Äù and expects a deal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also predicted a de-escalation of tensions.

This shift follows weeks of rising tariffs and sharp rhetoric that rattled global markets. The change in tone has helped fuel a stock market rebound, with Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng Index rising 2.4% on Wednesday.

Despite the optimism, a quick resolution seems unlikely. Beijing has been preparing its people for a long-term struggle, and trust between the two governments remains low.

China insists the U.S. must stop threats and show mutual respect for meaningful talks. Meanwhile, President Xi is working to strengthen ties with other countries in the region.

At a meeting with Azerbaijan‚Äôs president, Xi criticized tariffs as harmful to global trade. China also pushed back against U.S. moves in Latin America, accusing Washington of trying to control the Panama Canal. (From Walter Bloomberg)</title>

      <title>R to @KobeissiLetter: This coincided with a sudden shift in Trump&apos;s tone on China.

Trump is now claiming that tariffs on China will come down from 145%.

It seems like tariffs are set to come down and Powell is staying (for now).

      <title>BREAKING: Foreign investors pulled ~$5 billion out of US corporate bond funds over the last 2 weeks, the most since April 2020.

As a result, the 4-week moving average jumped to ~$1.2 billion, the highest since the 2020 pandemic.

During this time, the high-yield corporate bond ETF, $HYG, and the investment-grade corporate bond ETF, $LQD, have fallen by -1.2% and -0.9%, respectively.

Meanwhile, high-yield corporate bond spreads have risen 1.5 percentage points over the last 2 months, to 4.16%, near the highest in 2 years.

However, foreign investors still own ~$4.4 trillion, or 27%, of the total US corporate bond market, according to BofA.

Will foreigners continue dumping US¬†assets? (From TKL)</title>

      <title>Another recession signal has arrived:

The copper-to-gold ratio has dropped to its lowest level in at least 40 years.

This ratio has halved over the last 3 years.

The decline has accelerated over the last month as gold prices have risen +9% while copper prices have plummeted -8%.

A rapidly falling copper-to-gold ratio has historically signaled weakening global economic activity.

Previous major downturns in this indicator were seen during 2020 and 2008.

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 1) The way Austin has become more fairly valued is through two mechanisms.

First - prices have dropped 20.4% from their peak in 2022. Returning affordability.

Second - the median income in the metro has continued rising, and is now up to $102,000, increasing relative affordability. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>The first market to bottom in this housing downturn will be Austin, TX.

Prices are already down 20% from peak.

And the market has shifted from being 46% overvalued to now only 8% overvalued.

Buy the end of this year, Austin will be a &quot;buy&quot;. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>
