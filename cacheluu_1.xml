      <title>Global trade outlook is deteriorating:

The World Trade Organization expects world merchandise trade to fall -0.2% in 2025, down from +2.7% growth expected at the beginning of the year.

This would follow the +2.9% growth recorded in 2024.

North American trade is set to be hit the hardest, while Asia and Europe will continue to see modest growth.

The WTO also highlights that if the US imposes higher reciprocal tariffs after a 90-day pause, global merchandise trade could drop by -1.5% this year.

For 2026, the WTO forecasts +2.5% growth, down from the previously expected +2.9%.

Global trade is experiencing a historic slowdown. (From TKL)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 6) To be clear: all these housing markets still have some issues. Particularly, outbound migration. They all lost people during pandemic, and still might be losing some people today.

But in terms of fundamentals (home prices to income, and to rent) they are well-priced. And historically affordable.

Indicating we could be seeing a renaissance for the legacy big city housing markets the next 5 years. Especially if return to office mandates keep happening. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 5) I think this next one is my favorite, though. Cook County in Chicago.

In the last bubble, prices were trading at 5.2x incomes in Chicago.

Then there was a correction. And since then, values have kept pace with incomes, and today&apos;s 3.7x multiple is one of the cheapest in the country for a major city. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 4) Here&apos;s another example: Suffolk County, MA (Boston).

The Home/Value income ratio in Boston is 7.6x. today. Which is a hair below it&apos;s long-term 20-year average.

Inidcating that the growth in incomes has kept up with the growth in prices (there was actually a slight correction in prices in Boston the last 2 years). (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

Meaning homes/condos typically trade for 14x median income.

Yet today, they&apos;re trading for 10.8x median income.

The lowest multiple in decades. Indicating that the market is undervalued. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>Here are the counties in America that are &quot;undervalued&quot; in terms of home prices to income.

Manhattan - 25% undervalued
Bronx - 22%
DC - 18%
New Orelans - 11%
San Francisco- 11%
Queens - 5%
Brooklyn - 4%
Chicago - 3%
Boston - 2%

All legacy, big city housing markets for most part. They struggled during pandemic and lost people. But now they could be in for a turn-around.
