&lt;p&gt;Joe Tegtmeyer, a certified flight instructor, snapped high-resolution aerial images of the Tesla Giga Texas earlier today, which revealed what could be castings of the new Cybercab vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;

Monday&apos;s spotlight was on Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who issued another warning to clients about a &quot;code red&quot; situation unfolding at Tesla if CEO Elon Musk continued devoting time to DOGE-related efforts in Washington. Tesla shares fell 7% by late afternoon. However, one bright spot emerged on X around midday: aerial images show that Cybercab prototype builds may have already begun.

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vigilantfox.com/p/bill-maher-tells-charlie-kirk-whats&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Via The Vigilant Fox,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OblCcO7-Alg&quot;&gt;latest episode of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OblCcO7-Alg&quot;&gt;Club Random&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Bill Maher sat down with Turning Point USA founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/charliekirk11&quot;&gt;Charlie Kirk&lt;/a&gt; for what many expected to be a clash of political opposites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2827%29_5.jpg?itok=mvVd9vON&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2827%29_5.jpg?itok=mvVd9vON&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;6a09a25d-60bf-4ace-8550-537f63c065bf&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%2827%29_5.jpg?itok=mvVd9vON&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what unfolded was something far more surprising: a candid, wide-ranging conversation that revealed just how much common ground these two actually share—especially when it comes to calling out the modern left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It kicked off with a sharp joke from Kirk, who warned &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/billmaher&quot;&gt;Maher&lt;/a&gt; that the “purple-hair jihadis” would be coming for him next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They want to kill me just as bad. Oh, they really do!” &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/billmaher&quot;&gt;Maher&lt;/a&gt; responded. He explained, “&lt;strong&gt;They hate their own apostates more&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m supposed to get on the short bus to crazy town with them—and I won’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, Maher began to draw a clear line between classic liberal values and what he called the “woke” ideology taking over the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am one of them! They’re not one of me,” he said. “Liberal and woke are two completely different things—woke is very often the opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher explained, “Liberalism is, &lt;strong&gt;let’s live in a colorblind society&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s the goal. Woke’s goal is, ‘&lt;strong&gt;We see race everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;.’ Liberal is, ‘There’s a two-state solution.’ Woke is ‘river to the sea.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came a line that cut to the core of his frustration: “&lt;strong&gt;You got off the F-train, you fell asleep, and you got off at 20 stops too far. Don’t blame me for that&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;What started as a typical podcast on Club Random quickly turned into something way more revealing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/charliekirk11?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@charliekirk11&lt;/a&gt; and Bill Maher weren’t clashing on everything—they were connecting over one uncomfortable truth: the woke cult is tearing the country apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation pivoted to an issue even some liberals are struggling to defend: women’s sports. Kirk praised Maher for speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You deserve credit for being a liberal that acknowledges male-female distinctions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, of course! Of all the low-lying fruit the Democrats just hand the Republicans to win elections, that’s the one,” Maher responded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk grinned and asked, “Are they really gonna let us win every national election on this no-men-in-women’s-sports thing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher answered bluntly: “It’s so ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He cited the stat that &lt;strong&gt;890 trophies had already gone to biological males competing in women’s events&lt;/strong&gt;—and even pointed out that California’s own Gavin Newsom had backed away from the debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You lost Gavin Newsom on this,” he said. “Take that as a hint.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came the part no one saw coming. Maher opened up about a recent dinner he had with President Trump—and pushed back on the idea that engaging with him was somehow off-limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I voted for Obama, I voted for Clinton,” Maher said. “But the idea that I could talk to them as freely as I felt this conversation was going, is &lt;strong&gt;emblematic to me of why the Democrats lose the elections&lt;/strong&gt;. Because they just don’t feel that this is like a real person.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He got even more honest: “And I know it’s so weird to say that about Donald Trump, who I’ve said a jillion times is, you know, a whiny little b*tch, I could go through my greatest hits of insults. But this was about getting past that and maybe seeing that if we met in person, we don’t hate each other as much. And we don’t!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, &lt;strong&gt;I’m not going to pretend that’s a bad thing&lt;/strong&gt;,” Maher added.&lt;/p&gt;

Maher acknowledged his dinner with President Trump—and made it clear he wasn’t going to pretend it was a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You had more moral courage than pastors I know who went along with the woke crazy train,” he said. “You deserve credit for that—because it came at a high cost.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher nodded in agreement. For a moment, the two ideological opposites sounded completely in sync. Maher didn’t sugarcoat his assessment of what’s dragging his party down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Until we get rid of that sh*t, &lt;strong&gt;they’re never going to win another election&lt;/strong&gt;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk replied, “They’re not going to take political advice from me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher responded, “No, but they might from me. Not the 10%—but that’s 10%. They’re very loud, but that’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came a quote that’s never felt more relevant: “As FDR once said, ‘&lt;strong&gt;I welcome their hatred.&lt;/strong&gt;’”&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Bill Maher Tells Charlie Kirk What&apos;s Really Destroying The Democratic Party

            
Via The Vigilant Fox,
On the latest episode of Club Random, Bill Maher sat down with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk for what many expected to be a clash of political opposites.



But what unfolded was something far more surprising: a candid, wide-ranging conversation that revealed just how much common ground these two actually share—especially when it comes to calling out the modern left.
It kicked off with a sharp joke from Kirk, who warned Maher that the “purple-hair jihadis” would be coming for him next.
“They want to kill me just as bad. Oh, they really do!” Maher responded. He explained, “They hate their own apostates more. I’m supposed to get on the short bus to crazy town with them—and I won’t.”
From there, Maher began to draw a clear line between classic liberal values and what he called the “woke” ideology taking over the Democratic Party.
“I am one of them! They’re not one of me,” he said. “Liberal and woke are two completely different things—woke is very often the opposite.”
Maher explained, “Liberalism is, let’s live in a colorblind society. That’s the goal. Woke’s goal is, ‘We see race everywhere.’ Liberal is, ‘There’s a two-state solution.’ Woke is ‘river to the sea.’”
Then came a line that cut to the core of his frustration: “You got off the F-train, you fell asleep, and you got off at 20 stops too far. Don’t blame me for that.”
What started as a typical podcast on Club Random quickly turned into something way more revealing. @charliekirk11 and Bill Maher weren’t clashing on everything—they were connecting over one uncomfortable truth: the woke cult is tearing the country apart.

The conversation pivoted to an issue even some liberals are struggling to defend: women’s sports. Kirk praised Maher for speaking out.
“You deserve credit for being a liberal that acknowledges male-female distinctions,” he said.
“Oh, of course! Of all the low-lying fruit the Democrats just hand the Republicans to win elections, that’s the one,” Maher responded.
Kirk grinned and asked, “Are they really gonna let us win every national election on this no-men-in-women’s-sports thing?”

“I’m sorry, I’m not going to pretend that’s a bad thing,” Maher added.
Then came the part no one saw coming.

Maher acknowledged his dinner with President Trump—and made it clear he wasn’t going to pretend it was a bad thing.

That&apos;s when he dropped the line about Trump that will have Democrats in shambles:

“I voted for Obama, I voted Clinton,” he… pic.twitter.com/Be0Jf5X6hF

That’s when Kirk delivered a line that stopped the conversation cold.
“You had more moral courage than pastors I know who went along with the woke crazy train,” he said. “You deserve credit for that—because it came at a high cost.”
Maher nodded in agreement. For a moment, the two ideological opposites sounded completely in sync. Maher didn’t sugarcoat his assessment of what’s dragging his party down.
“Until we get rid of that sh*t, they’re never going to win another election,” he said.
Kirk replied, “They’re not going to take political advice from me.”
Maher responded, “No, but they might from me. Not the 10%—but that’s 10%. They’re very loud, but that’s it.”
Then came a quote that’s never felt more relevant: “As FDR once said, ‘I welcome their hatred.’”
That’s when Kirk hit Maher with a line that stopped the conversation cold—and sparked one of the most powerful moments of their exchange.

Two men with very different worldviews just exposed what many Americans already sense: the far left isn’t leading the Democrats forward. It’s dragging them down. And unless the party finds the courage to cut that anchor loose, it’s going to sink with it.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;&quot;China Will Never Accept It&quot;: Beijing Warns Countries Against Trade Deal With Trump At China&apos;s Expense&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s starting to smell like a real trade war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just days after the WSJ reported that Scott Bessent&apos;s grand trade war strategy was to force more than 70 US trade partners to sign bilateral deals while aligning against China, &lt;strong&gt;Beijing has warned it will retaliate against countries that negotiate trade deals with the US “at the expense of China’s interests”, &lt;/strong&gt;fueling global tensions as the world’s two economic superpowers lunge at each other over tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests,” the ministry said on Monday. &lt;strong&gt;“If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“China respects the right of all parties to resolve their economic and trade differences with the United States through equal consultations,” the commerce ministry said adding that if countries encroached on Beijing’s interests, it was “determined and capable of safeguarding its own rights”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ministry added that “all parties should stand on the side of fairness and justice and should defend international economic and trade rules and the multilateral trading system”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It said:&lt;strong&gt; “Once international trade returns to the ‘law of the jungle’, where the strong prey on the weak, all countries will become victims.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_3277f51446f143eda489a1bd5de6f72f.html&quot;&gt;statement by China&apos;s commerce ministry,&lt;/a&gt; which was in response to reports that Trump’s administration planned to use trade talks with multiple countries to try to isolate China, called &lt;strong&gt;on them to instead join Beijing to “resist unilateral bullying.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sharp escalation follows the failure to gain any traction in trade and tariff negotiations. Trump has called several times for Beijing to open negotiations to avert a trade war, and China has said it is open to talks, but neither side has signalled that high-level contacts are under way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While last week&apos;s WSJ report said the US strategy to gang up on China was intended to pressure Beijing to come to the negotiating table and abandon its defiant stance, China has shown little sign of backing down. Instead, president Xi Jinping visited Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia last week, where he sought to shore up relations with Beijing’s trading partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South-east Asian exporters face steep tariffs under the Trump administration, which has also accused them of serving as a transshipment conduit for Chinese goods. Unfortunately for them, without the US as a final customer for most of their exports (including Chinese transshipments), and vows of solidarity will be hollow once countless Pacific rim factories go dark &lt;strong&gt;sparking an economic and labor crisis in countries which have virtually no social safety net.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while China has ironically sought to portray itself as a pillar of the international trading system, it is struggling with weak domestic demand following a deep property slowdown, forcing policymakers to lean on manufacturing and exports for economic growth and leaving the economy vulnerable to the trade war with the US. As a reminder, some 40% of Chinese economic growth is in the form of trade, and while the hit to the US would be mostly along the inflationary and capital market pathways, once more than a third of China&apos;s economy is forced to find new end markets,  the pain for the domestic economic will be orders of magnitude worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s also why Goldman now expects &lt;strong&gt;China&apos;s Q2 real GDP growth to collapse to 0.8% qoq ann from 4.9% in Q1. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Beijing has repeatedly promised various initiatives to spur consumption but has held back from launching a “bazooka” fiscal stimulus (something it can&apos;t do since it has hit debt saturation), instead investing heavily in industry to shake off its reliance on western technology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>&quot;China Will Never Accept It&quot;: Beijing Warns Countries Against Trade Deal With Trump At China&apos;s Expense

            
It&apos;s starting to smell like a real trade war.
Just days after the WSJ reported that Scott Bessent&apos;s grand trade war strategy was to force more than 70 US trade partners to sign bilateral deals while aligning against China, Beijing has warned it will retaliate against countries that negotiate trade deals with the US “at the expense of China’s interests”, fueling global tensions as the world’s two economic superpowers lunge at each other over tariffs.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;&quot;That&apos;s Creepy AF&quot;: Whose Hand Is This? &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why has public confidence in the Democratic Party collapsed to record lows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the party that champions illegal alien terrorists and cultural Marxism lost its authenticity a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voters see right through the bullshit of lies, non-sense identity politics, performative accents, and teleprompter-scripted speeches. The American people became outraged last week after Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/political/socialist-aoc-bernie-sanders-caught-using-private-jets-while-fighting-oligarchy-tour&quot;&gt;caught flying around on private jets&lt;/a&gt; while &quot;fighting oligarchy.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the rudderless party is being thrown into a civil war, caught between old-school moderates and far-left activists like David Hogg, Jasmine Crockett, Hakeem Jeffries, and AoC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest Gallup polling data was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/political/confidence-democratic-leadership-sinks-record-low-party-implodes&quot;&gt;nothing more than disastrous&lt;/a&gt; for the party of wokeism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Democratic leadership&apos;s latest 25% confidence rating is an all-time low for the group — well below the previous 34% low recorded in 2023 and the average of 45% since 2001,&quot; Gallup wrote in a report, adding, &quot;Confidence ratings were last at the majority level in 2009 for Democratic congressional leaders and in 2003 for Republican congressional leaders.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_08-48-10.png?itok=3IC8wsOP&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_08-48-10.png?itok=3IC8wsOP&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;f4d03eee-06d6-437f-bd2d-6882c9bb821b&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-20_08-48-10.png?itok=3IC8wsOP&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all of this—and returning to the theme of authenticity—it&apos;s no surprise that a majority of Americans have gravitated toward the &apos;America First&apos; movement. President Trump doesn&apos;t need a teleprompter; he speaks his mind directly and genuinely, which resonates with people who just want peace and prosperity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/political/tesla-takedown-organizers-plan-color-revolution-kill-brand-death-spiral-investors&quot;&gt;not domestic terrorism and protests&lt;/a&gt; that Democrats seem to have embraced in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the theme of authenticity in mind, internet sleuths point out that the Biden team may have photoshopped the former president into a family Easter photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As some users noted on X, the giveaway was a strangely placed, almost creepy-looking hand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>&quot;That&apos;s Creepy AF&quot;: Whose Hand Is This? 

            
Why has public confidence in the Democratic Party collapsed to record lows?
In short, the party that champions illegal alien terrorists and cultural Marxism lost its authenticity a long time ago.
Voters see right through the bullshit of lies, non-sense identity politics, performative accents, and teleprompter-scripted speeches. The American people became outraged last week after Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders were caught flying around on private jets while &quot;fighting oligarchy.&quot; 
Meanwhile, the rudderless party is being thrown into a civil war, caught between old-school moderates and far-left activists like David Hogg, Jasmine Crockett, Hakeem Jeffries, and AoC. 
The latest Gallup polling data was nothing more than disastrous for the party of wokeism:
&quot;Democratic leadership&apos;s latest 25% confidence rating is an all-time low for the group — well below the previous 34% low recorded in 2023 and the average of 45% since 2001,&quot; Gallup wrote in a report, adding, &quot;Confidence ratings were last at the majority level in 2009 for Democratic congressional leaders and in 2003 for Republican congressional leaders.&quot;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;The Death Cross And Market Bottoms&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/the-death-cross-and-market-bottoms/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In financial markets, few technical patterns generate as much attention and anxiety as &lt;strong&gt;the death cross&lt;/strong&gt;. This ominous-sounding term refers to a crossover on a price chart when a short-term moving average, most commonly the 50-day moving average (50-DMA), drops below a long-term moving average, usually the 200-day moving average (200-DMA). The &lt;em&gt;“death cross”&lt;/em&gt; is a fantastic headline for the media to generate clicks and views. However, for investors, the &lt;em&gt;“death cross”&lt;/em&gt; signals a market correction and suggests a more cautious investing approach. But there are a few questions we must answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What does the death cross mean?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How reliable is it as an indicator?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And how should investors respond when they see it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s answer those questions by exploring the death cross’s history, data, and interpretations, and explaining why context matters more than the signal itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Trader-Bear-Market-Liquidity-e17.jpg?itok=E50imApu&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Trader-Bear-Market-Liquidity-e17.jpg?itok=E50imApu&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;4e57f7b4-800e-47df-9af2-b43d01654b06&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Trader-Bear-Market-Liquidity-e17.jpg?itok=E50imApu&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is the Death Cross?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Investopedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The “death cross” market chart pattern refers to the drop of a short-term moving average—meaning the average of recent closing prices for a stock, stock index, commodity, or cryptocurrency over a set period of time—below a longer-term moving average. The most closely watched stock-market moving averages are the 50-day and the 200-day.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For investors, it is essential to note that the death cross is a lagging indicator. It only tells you that price action has deteriorated during the previous two months. In other words, it often only confirms an already obvious trend because it relies on historical data from moving averages. Furthermore, when the death cross occurs, markets are often near a short-term low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss to state that there are periods where the death cross preceded more severe bear markets of the past century, including 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008. However, that is an example of sample selection bias, expressed by using only the selected data points to prove the predictive power of the death cross. Unfortunately, selecting only those data points ignores the numerous occasions when the death cross signaled nothing worse than a market correction and provided significant buying opportunities for investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the following table from Marketwatch shows that since 1950, markets tend to rise within the next 12 months following a death cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-151.jpg?itok=FjHPteKq&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-151.jpg?itok=FjHPteKq&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;f5ee85f4-5659-48da-b5bc-d337a641fadc&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-151.jpg?itok=FjHPteKq&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because, as noted, the markets tend to be very oversold by the time the death cross triggers, and previous optimistic sentiment has reversed. We noted this in this past weekend’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/is-risk-off-positioning-signaling-a-market-low/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;#BullBearReport.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For example, net bullish sentiment among retail and institutional investors is at some of the lowest levels on record, including during the “Financial Crisis.” The extreme negativity is interesting because the recent decline was orderly and mild compared to the chaos during the financial crisis. Yet, investors are as bearish on the current market as they were then. However, it is worth noting that during previous instances when sentiment was as negative as it is currently, such readings were near market bottoms.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-143%20%281%29.jpg?itok=oeGy281-&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-143%20%281%29.jpg?itok=oeGy281-&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;cec02408-7ea5-4f80-bcee-c1373fb7f26a&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-143%20%281%29.jpg?itok=oeGy281-&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Furthermore, the sharp spike in the volatility index, which is considered a “market fear gauge,” spiked to the highest levels seen since the COVID pandemic. If we combine the sentiment measures with the volatility index, we again see more extreme negative readings that often coincide with market lows rather than the beginning of larger reversions.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-144%20%281%29.jpg?itok=bHwCE9h9&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-144%20%281%29.jpg?itok=bHwCE9h9&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;f161f12d-8d6a-4a30-b3f8-6f02abd7e304&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-144%20%281%29.jpg?itok=bHwCE9h9&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, historically speaking, the death cross, more often than not, is a potential contrarian indicator. However, as noted above, there have been instances where the death cross led to much more severe declines. How can investors differentiate between the two?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-structural-bear-markets-versus-event-driven-corrections&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Bear Markets Versus Event-Driven&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Corrections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the media often dramatizes the appearance of a death cross, seasoned investors know it is just one piece of the puzzle. Corrections are part of a normal and healthy market process. As discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/bullish-years-often-have-corrections/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Bullish Years Have Corrections Too:”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In bullish years, markets often have corrections. Yet, after a lengthy bullish run, it always surprises me how quickly investors and the media panic with the slightest hint of a market pullback. During bullish years, corrections happen more often than you think. However, when corrections occur, it is not uncommon to see concerns about a “bear market” rise. However, historically speaking, the stock market increases about 73% of the time. The other 27% of the time, market corrections reverse the excesses of the previous advance. The table below shows the dispersion of returns over time. Critically, note that drawdowns of greater than 10% only occur 13% of the time.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-75-4_0.jpg?itok=qv9UfaiQ&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-75-4_0.jpg?itok=qv9UfaiQ&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;5c7114dd-aef4-4445-bed4-01f02b168b73&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;283&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-75-4_0.jpg?itok=qv9UfaiQ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The correction from this year’s market peak is currently in a range that has only occurred 7% of the time historically, with the market declining 19.4% from peak to trough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-153.jpg?itok=Ft2utgkW&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-153.jpg?itok=Ft2utgkW&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;872aa608-4a35-4507-aa6d-cd36018fd307&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;374&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-153.jpg?itok=Ft2utgkW&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far this year, the market decline certainly ranks among some of the worst-performing years in history. However, we are only one-third of the way into 2025, so how this year ends is still widely unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Annual-vs-Intra-Year-Returns-202.jpg?itok=YOiy2Q4m&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Annual-vs-Intra-Year-Returns-202.jpg?itok=YOiy2Q4m&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;dc7a0a09-03de-469d-a55c-047705037d63&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Annual-vs-Intra-Year-Returns-202.jpg?itok=YOiy2Q4m&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is worth noting that since 1980, only eight (8) years have ended with more significant declines. Could this be the ninth? Yes, but for that to occur, we must put previous market declines and larger bear markets into context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between whether the death cross is a shorter-term corrective process or a larger &lt;em&gt;“bear market” decline &lt;/em&gt;depends mainly on whether the cause of the market decline is &lt;em&gt;“event-driven”&lt;/em&gt; or “&lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt;.” As noted recently by the Daily Shot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Structural bear markets have historically been the deepest and longest, averaging over 55% declines and lasting nearly four years. In contrast, event-driven bears tend to be shorter and shallower, with quicker recoveries—averaging around 30% declines and under 10 months in duration. Post-WWII averages (orange diamonds) suggest more moderate outcomes relative to the broader historical record.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-154.jpg?itok=duXwFsGk&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-154.jpg?itok=duXwFsGk&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;638c8b32-6c6c-4200-bebc-f389fb783729&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-154.jpg?itok=duXwFsGk&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This context is important when examining the current decline and triggering of the &lt;em&gt;“death cross.”&lt;/em&gt; The chart below shows the difference in the length of &lt;em&gt;“event-driven”&lt;/em&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;“structural”&lt;/em&gt; corrections, signified by the triggering of the&lt;em&gt; “death cross.”&lt;/em&gt; The dot.com and financial crisis periods were structural events, as significant corporate failures and credit-market dislocations occurred amid deep economic contractions. However, outside of those two significant structural impacts, all other &lt;em&gt;“events” &lt;/em&gt;were short-lived, and markets soon recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/50-200-DMA-Death-Cross-and-Event.jpg?itok=wu5ZNgj0&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/50-200-DMA-Death-Cross-and-Event.jpg?itok=wu5ZNgj0&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;751d7649-599c-49e2-8ee9-0a087c6207e1&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/50-200-DMA-Death-Cross-and-Event.jpg?itok=wu5ZNgj0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the current market correction is driven by concerns over &lt;em&gt;“tariffs,”&lt;/em&gt; it will likely be short-lived. There are two reasons for this view. First, the announced tariffs, which were more onerous than expected, will likely be largely reduced or removed through negotiations. Second, once the tariffs are finalized, the markets will adjust expectations for earnings and focus on future growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question for investors is how to navigate the current market turmoil until this event-driven correction completes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-navigating-the-uncertainty&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigating The Uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean you should ignore the &lt;em&gt;“death cross”&lt;/em&gt; entirely? No. While the current correction is &lt;em&gt;“event-driven”&lt;/em&gt; and will likely resolve itself soon, there is always a risk that something could trigger a &lt;em&gt;“structural”&lt;/em&gt; decline, such as a recession or credit-related event. &lt;strong&gt;While such a risk remains quite low currently, that risk is not zero.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the death cross should not be viewed in isolation or trigger panic-driven decisions. Instead, investors should use it as a cue to take a more thoughtful approach to their portfolio management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅ Stay the Course if Fundamentals Are Sound&lt;/strong&gt;. If your portfolio is well-diversified and aligned with long-term goals, the death cross may just be &lt;strong&gt;noise&lt;/strong&gt; within a broader market cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🌐 Use It as a Risk Management Cue&lt;/strong&gt;. As we noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/the-market-crash-a-set-up-for-a-rally/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Market Crash: Hope In The Fear,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we used the recent rally in the market to reduce risk, hedge portfolios, raise cash, and rebalance allocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📊 Combine with Other Indicators&lt;/strong&gt;. As noted above, while ominous, the current death cross collides with deeply oversold technical readings, as shown below, which typically suggest markets are near short-term lows rather than starting more significant declines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://sentimentrader.com/&quot;&gt;Sentimentrader&lt;/a&gt; tracks 21 indicators in total, which are then combined into a single indicator, giving readings of when markets are trading at more extreme bullish or bearish levels. As shown, the market is currently trading at more extreme risk-off levels. While this does not mean the market is about to rise, historically, such extreme readings have been close to market bottoms.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-125%20%281%29.jpg?itok=IYlVEAEG&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-125%20%281%29.jpg?itok=IYlVEAEG&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;2fb7ee10-dee9-46ce-8861-ff2b34f0d97e&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;289&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-125%20%281%29.jpg?itok=IYlVEAEG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚡ Consider Rebalancing or Rotating&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether the current period is &lt;em&gt;“event-driven”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“structural&lt;/em&gt;,” the market will have intermittent rallies which investors should use to rebalance risk, reallocate holdings, and increase cash levels to reduce volatility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💡 Don’t Ignore the Golden Cross&lt;/strong&gt;. While it is easy to become overly defensive during a corrective period, it is important to remember that eventually the “death cross” will reverse the crossover. When the 50-DMA rises above the 200-DMA, it creates the golden cross, which follows the market bottom. That signals a reversal of the previous process of reducing risk to increasing risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;h-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The death cross is a useful indicator, not a prophecy. It reflects short-term weakness, but doesn’t dictate the future. The key is to treat it as a &lt;strong&gt;signal to pay closer attention&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to the bigger picture, not a call to sell everything and flee to cash.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term investors should remain focused on &lt;strong&gt;fundamentals, diversification, and goals&lt;/strong&gt;. Short-term traders can use it as one of many tools to refine timing. Either way, understanding the death cross puts you in a better position to act with insight rather than emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>The Death Cross And Market Bottoms

In financial markets, few technical patterns generate as much attention and anxiety as the death cross. This ominous-sounding term refers to a crossover on a price chart when a short-term moving average, most commonly the 50-day moving average (50-DMA), drops below a long-term moving average, usually the 200-day moving average (200-DMA). The “death cross” is a fantastic headline for the media to generate clicks and views. However, for investors, the “death cross” signals a market correction and suggests a more cautious investing approach. But there are a few questions we must answer.

	
What does the death cross mean?
How reliable is it as an indicator?
And how should investors respond when they see it?
Let’s answer those questions by exploring the death cross’s history, data, and interpretations, and explaining why context matters more than the signal itself.



What Is the Death Cross?
According to Investopedia:
“The “death cross” market chart pattern refers to the drop of a short-term moving average—meaning the average of recent closing prices for a stock, stock index, commodity, or cryptocurrency over a set period of time—below a longer-term moving average. The most closely watched stock-market moving averages are the 50-day and the 200-day.”
For investors, it is essential to note that the death cross is a lagging indicator. It only tells you that price action has deteriorated during the previous two months. In other words, it often only confirms an already obvious trend because it relies on historical data from moving averages. Furthermore, when the death cross occurs, markets are often near a short-term low.
I would be remiss to state that there are periods where the death cross preceded more severe bear markets of the past century, including 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008. However, that is an example of sample selection bias, expressed by using only the selected data points to prove the predictive power of the death cross. Unfortunately, selecting only those data points ignores the numerous occasions when the death cross signaled nothing worse than a market correction and provided significant buying opportunities for investors.
For example, the following table from Marketwatch shows that since 1950, markets tend to rise within the next 12 months following a death cross.



This is because, as noted, the markets tend to be very oversold by the time the death cross triggers, and previous optimistic sentiment has reversed. We noted this in this past weekend’s #BullBearReport.
“For example, net bullish sentiment among retail and institutional investors is at some of the lowest levels on record, including during the “Financial Crisis.” The extreme negativity is interesting because the recent decline was orderly and mild compared to the chaos during the financial crisis. Yet, investors are as bearish on the current market as they were then. However, it is worth noting that during previous instances when sentiment was as negative as it is currently, such readings were near market bottoms.”



“Furthermore, the sharp spike in the volatility index, which is considered a “market fear gauge,” spiked to the highest levels seen since the COVID pandemic. If we combine the sentiment measures with the volatility index, we again see more extreme negative readings that often coincide with market lows rather than the beginning of larger reversions.”



In other words, historically speaking, the death cross, more often than not, is a potential contrarian indicator. However, as noted above, there have been instances where the death cross led to much more severe declines. How can investors differentiate between the two?
Structural Bear Markets Versus Event-Driven Corrections
While the media often dramatizes the appearance of a death cross, seasoned investors know it is just one piece of the puzzle. Corrections are part of a normal and healthy market process. As discussed in “Bullish Years Have Corrections Too:”
“In bullish years, markets often have corrections. Yet, after a lengthy bullish run, it always surprises me how quickly investors and the media panic with the slightest hint of a market pullback. During bullish years, corrections happen more often than you think. However, when corrections occur, it is not uncommon to see concerns about a “bear market” rise. However, historically speaking, the stock market increases about 73% of the time. The other 27% of the time, market corrections reverse the excesses of the previous advance. The table below shows the dispersion of returns over time. Critically, note that drawdowns of greater than 10% only occur 13% of the time.”



The correction from this year’s market peak is currently in a range that has only occurred 7% of the time historically, with the market declining 19.4% from peak to trough.



So far this year, the market decline certainly ranks among some of the worst-performing years in history. However, we are only one-third of the way into 2025, so how this year ends is still widely unpredictable.



But it is worth noting that since 1980, only eight (8) years have ended with more significant declines. Could this be the ninth? Yes, but for that to occur, we must put previous market declines and larger bear markets into context.
The difference between whether the death cross is a shorter-term corrective process or a larger “bear market” decline depends mainly on whether the cause of the market decline is “event-driven” or “structural.” As noted recently by the Daily Shot:
“Structural bear markets have historically been the deepest and longest, averaging over 55% declines and lasting nearly four years. In contrast, event-driven bears tend to be shorter and shallower, with quicker recoveries—averaging around 30% declines and under 10 months in duration. Post-WWII averages (orange diamonds) suggest more moderate outcomes relative to the broader historical record.”



This context is important when examining the current decline and triggering of the “death cross.” The chart below shows the difference in the length of “event-driven” versus “structural” corrections, signified by the triggering of the “death cross.” The dot.com and financial crisis periods were structural events, as significant corporate failures and credit-market dislocations occurred amid deep economic contractions. However, outside of those two significant structural impacts, all other “events” were short-lived, and markets soon recovered.



Given that the current market correction is driven by concerns over “tariffs,” it will likely be short-lived. There are two reasons for this view. First, the announced tariffs, which were more onerous than expected, will likely be largely reduced or removed through negotiations. Second, once the tariffs are finalized, the markets will adjust expectations for earnings and focus on future growth.
The question for investors is how to navigate the current market turmoil until this event-driven correction completes.
Navigating The Uncertainty
Does this mean you should ignore the “death cross” entirely? No. While the current correction is “event-driven” and will likely resolve itself soon, there is always a risk that something could trigger a “structural” decline, such as a recession or credit-related event. While such a risk remains quite low currently, that risk is not zero.
Furthermore, the death cross should not be viewed in isolation or trigger panic-driven decisions. Instead, investors should use it as a cue to take a more thoughtful approach to their portfolio management.
✅ Stay the Course if Fundamentals Are Sound. If your portfolio is well-diversified and aligned with long-term goals, the death cross may just be noise within a broader market cycle.
🌐 Use It as a Risk Management Cue. As we noted in “Market Crash: Hope In The Fear,” we used the recent rally in the market to reduce risk, hedge portfolios, raise cash, and rebalance allocations.
📊 Combine with Other Indicators. As noted above, while ominous, the current death cross collides with deeply oversold technical readings, as shown below, which typically suggest markets are near short-term lows rather than starting more significant declines.
“Sentimentrader tracks 21 indicators in total, which are then combined into a single indicator, giving readings of when markets are trading at more extreme bullish or bearish levels. As shown, the market is currently trading at more extreme risk-off levels. While this does not mean the market is about to rise, historically, such extreme readings have been close to market bottoms.”



⚡ Consider Rebalancing or Rotating. Whether the current period is “event-driven” or “structural,” the market will have intermittent rallies which investors should use to rebalance risk, reallocate holdings, and increase cash levels to reduce volatility.
💡 Don’t Ignore the Golden Cross. While it is easy to become overly defensive during a corrective period, it is important to remember that eventually the “death cross” will reverse the crossover. When the 50-DMA rises above the 200-DMA, it creates the golden cross, which follows the market bottom. That signals a reversal of the previous process of reducing risk to increasing risk.
Conclusion
The death cross is a useful indicator, not a prophecy. It reflects short-term weakness, but doesn’t dictate the future. The key is to treat it as a signal to pay closer attention to the bigger picture, not a call to sell everything and flee to cash.
Long-term investors should remain focused on fundamentals, diversification, and goals. Short-term traders can use it as one of many tools to refine timing. Either way, understanding the death cross puts you in a better position to act with insight rather than emotion.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Jury Convicts Renovaro Biosciences Founder Of Orchestrating Murder-For-Hire Of His Former Business Partner&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal jury on Friday convicted former Enochian Biosciences (now Renovaro) &quot;scientific founder&quot;, &quot;inventor&quot; and former largest shareholder Serhat Gumrukcu of orchestrating the 2018 murder-for-hire of his former business partner in Vermont, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://vtdigger.org/2025/04/18/jury-convicts-accused-leader-of-murder-for-hire-plot-that-killed-vermont-man-on-all-charges/&quot;&gt;VTDigger.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jury found Gumrukcu - who was brought to the attention of market participants &lt;a href=&quot;https://hindenburgresearch.com/enochian/&quot;&gt;by former short seller Hindenburg Research back in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, alongside of &lt;a href=&quot;https://sharesleuth.com/enochian-biosciences-stunning-murder-allegations-raise-fresh-questions-about-companys-main-medical-mind/&quot;&gt;ShareSleuth&lt;/a&gt; - guilty on all three felony charges: murder for hire, conspiracy to commit murder for hire, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He now faces a mandatory life sentence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gumrukcu was taken into custody shortly afterward. Jurors deliberated for about six hours, including a lunch break, returning their decision Friday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gumrukcu had formerly been praised by Enochian CEO Mark Dybul - who once worked under Anthony Fauci at the National Institute of Health - with Dybul &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1527728/000173112219000737/e1600_99-1.htm#:~:text=Dr.%20G%C3%BCmr%C3%BCkc%C3%BC%20has%20licensed,of%2C%20and%20explained%20them.%E2%80%9D&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:window.open(&apos;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1527728/000173112219000737/e1600_99-1.htm#:~:text=Dr.%20G%C3%BCmr%C3%BCkc%C3%BC%20has%20licensed,of%2C%20and%20explained%20them.%E2%80%9D&apos;, &apos;_blank&apos;, &apos;noopener&apos;); return false;&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; in November 2019 that he was &quot;one of those rare geniuses that is not bound by scientific discipline or dogma&quot;. Hindenburg &lt;a href=&quot;https://hindenburgresearch.com/renovaro/&quot;&gt;accused Dybul&lt;/a&gt; of turning a &quot;blind eye to outrageous fraud&quot; perpetrated by Gumrukcu in a stunning follow up report after the &quot;inventor&apos;s&quot; death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Enochian30.png?itok=zKdLwFad&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Enochian30.png?itok=zKdLwFad&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;969daa57-9813-49be-ab7a-0f6a5ee20c7b&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Enochian30.png?itok=zKdLwFad&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mark Dybul, far left, Serhat Gumrukcu, second from left&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being removed from Enochian, the company changed its name and continued without Gumrukcu. The murder for hire case stems from the killing of 39-year-old Gregory Davis, which prosecutors say was ordered by Gumrukcu over a soured oil deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This verdict is the product of years of investigative work,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Drescher, commending the efforts of federal and local law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a Turkish national living in a Los Angeles mansion, Gumrukcu now awaits formal sentencing later this year. His attorney could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A supposed mind-reading magician turned biomedical entrepreneur, Serhat Gumrukcu mingled with Hollywood elites and earned millions through unconventional medical ventures. But during his five-week trial in Burlington, he faced a far different spotlight—three days on the witness stand, denying involvement in the 2018 murder-for-hire of former business partner Gregory Davis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though he claimed innocence,&lt;strong&gt; Gumrukcu admitted under oath to lying to authorities and said he&apos;d told “so many lies” in past deals he couldn’t remember them all&lt;/strong&gt;. He acknowledged buying a fake medical degree from Russia, calling it “cheating,” and described his younger self as “arrogant,” advocating unorthodox treatments like leeches and mistletoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of their investigation into Enochian and Gumrukcu, Hindenburg Research ordered the very same degree to prove that it was fake back in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors argued Gumrukcu had Davis killed to prevent him from exposing fraud tied to a failed oil deal—one that could have derailed a lucrative biomedical contract with Enochian BioSciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Gregg Davis was a problem for the defendant,” said prosecutor Paul Van de Graaf. “It was the defendant who paid for the murder.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Van de Graaf outlined how Gumrukcu financed the $200,000 plot, with testimony from three co-conspirators, including former assistant Berk Eratay. Eratay claimed Gumrukcu told him he wanted to “get rid of a problem,” prompting Eratay to enlist others, including hitman Jerry Banks. Banks testified he posed as a U.S. marshal, kidnapped Davis, and executed him in rural Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense attorney Ethan Balogh argued it was Eratay who “ran the op,” not Gumrukcu. He said the funds were meant for a cryptocurrency project and portrayed Davis as untrustworthy. Balogh accused the three key witnesses—who took plea deals to avoid life sentences—of lying to save themselves: “These men were all going to die in the cage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors countered that none of them had a reason to kill Davis—except Gumrukcu. As Van de Graaf said, even “peaceful” men can outsource their violence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Jury Convicts Renovaro Biosciences Founder Of Orchestrating Murder-For-Hire Of His Former Business Partner

            
A federal jury on Friday convicted former Enochian Biosciences (now Renovaro) &quot;scientific founder&quot;, &quot;inventor&quot; and former largest shareholder Serhat Gumrukcu of orchestrating the 2018 murder-for-hire of his former business partner in Vermont, according to VTDigger.com.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;This One Weird Trick Let D.C. Judges Stage A Coup&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.danielgreenfield.org/2025/04/this-one-weird-trick-let-dc-judges.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Daniel Greenfield,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supreme Court’s ruling in J.G.G. v. Donald J. Trump was not an unqualified triumph for the Trump administration’s deportations of foreign gang members, but it was a definite rebuke not just to Judge Boasberg, but to the entire D.C. Circuit Court shadow government.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image_2025-04-20_213237519.jpg?itok=E6AvwzsY&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_2025-04-20_213237519.jpg?itok=E6AvwzsY&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ab7038eb-26c2-4ad7-9d7a-bf1d2259c7af&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_2025-04-20_213237519.jpg?itok=E6AvwzsY&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ACLU filed J.G.G. v. Trump in defense of five Venezuelan inmates in New York and Texas. All of the men claimed that they were not gang members and there was no indication that any of them were being deported, denying them any actual standing for coming before the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Especially before Judge James Boasberg who is thousands of miles away in Washington D.C.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of standing and the case being filed in the wrong venue, Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court, not only blocked the deportation of all gang members back to Venezuela, but ordered that planes currently over international airspace that were carrying gang members turn around and bring them back to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boasberg fumed that the planes were not turned around on his mere word and threatened the Justice Department with repercussions for not recognizing his power over not only the entire country, but also the entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But why was a judge from the D.C. Circuit Court on a case involving inmates in Texas?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that leftist organizations and the judges of the D.C. Circuit Court were using one weird trick to seize power over the entire country (if not always the planet) and transform themselves into a shadow government able to block any Trump administration move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court’s ruling vacating Boasberg’s order stated that, “the detainees are confined in Texas, so venue is improper in the District of Columbia” and directed that the appropriate “venue lies in the district of confinement”. So how did a D.C. judge ever get involved at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s concurrence he noted that the “only question is where that judicial review should occur. That venue question turns on whether these transfer claims belong in habeas corpus proceedings or instead may be brought under the Administrative Procedure Act.” The Supreme Court’s ruling even noted that “initially the detainees sought relief in habeas among other causes of action, but they dismissed their habeas claims” and stated that “their claims fall within the ‘core’ of the writ of habeas corpus and thus must be brought in habeas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kavanaugh then laid out a brief history of detainees, including those terrorists at Gitmo, bringing claims under habeas corpus rather than, strangely, under the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Administrative Procedure Act had been created in response to the rise of a vast unaccountable government bureaucracy under FDR. The APA was supposed to stop the administrative state from turning into exactly the kind of self-governing machine it grew into which FDR had described&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontpagemag.com/judicial-coup/&quot;&gt; as threatening to&lt;/a&gt; “develop a fourth branch of government for which there is no sanction in the Constitution.” It was not meant to block presidents from executing their policies or subject every one of those policies to the review of the D.C. Circuit Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The D.C. Circuit Court however has enabled every leftist ‘resistance’ group to go ‘judge shopping’ and file APA complaints to block anything and everything President Trump does.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the ACLU appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court, wielding the Administrative Procedure Act, to challenge the question of whether President Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act (which predated the APA by 148 years) applied and what could be defined as wartime. The ACLU was asking Boasberg to block President Trump’s use of presidential powers based on an act meant to check bureaucratic overreach. And Judge Boasberg went ahead and tried to seize control of U.S. forces abroad from President Trump in the name of an act meant to regulate agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supreme Court’s response to this unconstitutional abomination was milder than it deserved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gave the ACLU and Boasberg the idea that they could get away with it? The ACLU had previously sued the Trump administration for removing materials falsely describing the existence of a ‘transgender’ society as a violation of the “Administrative Procedure Act” by “removing articles without a reasoned basis” as if that were a matter subject to the APA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another case, ‘Judge’ Ana Reyes, a Uruguayan activist lawyer appointed by Biden as the first gay ‘Latinx’ judge in the D.C. Circuit Court, blocked the removal of mentally ill individuals who hallucinate the idea that they are members of some other sex than their biological one, by claiming that it’ss “soaked in animus and dripping with pretext, Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit” and argued, despite the mountain of evidence, that the Department of Defense had “not provided a legitimate reason for banning all transgender troops” and therefore violated the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reyes had confused the Administrative Procedure Act with her own personal opinion and rather than ruling on the legality of a policy based on actual laws, abused the APA to seize power over the Pentagon to promote her own favored social and sexual worldviews in the APA’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the Supreme Court has begun shooting down some APA abuses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its response to a Biden judge in Massachusetts blocking the Trump administration from ending education grants that violate its ban on DEI, the court noted that Judge Myong Joun and the court “lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA” and that monetary cases involving the government are supposed to go to the Court of Federal Claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The APA has become a favored weapon of choice whether the issue at hand is financial, foreign policy, deporting illegal aliens or even publishing materials about the existence of transgenderism on government websites. During the first term of the administration, leftist groups had taken to boasting of having entire “teams of APA litigators and experts”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And with a 93% loss rate for the Trump administration in APA cases, the judicial coup was a sound strategy. &lt;/strong&gt;All a leftist judge had to do was declare that the Trump administration’s actions were “poorly reasoned” or lacked “sufficient rationale” and would override the president’s orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The APA enabled a massive shift of power from the executive branch to district courts, and to the D.C. Circuit Court which had seized virtually unlimited power from both the president and local courts and judges in the process creating an unelected shadow government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the D.C. judicial shadow government overreached itself. And Boasberg’s attempt to seize presidential powers has created a constitutional moment of crisis that may unwind the coup.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>This One Weird Trick Let D.C. Judges Stage A Coup

            
Authored by Daniel Greenfield,
The Supreme Court’s ruling in J.G.G. v. Donald J. Trump was not an unqualified triumph for the Trump administration’s deportations of foreign gang members, but it was a definite rebuke not just to Judge Boasberg, but to the entire D.C. Circuit Court shadow government.



The ACLU filed J.G.G. v. Trump in defense of five Venezuelan inmates in New York and Texas. All of the men claimed that they were not gang members and there was no indication that any of them were being deported, denying them any actual standing for coming before the court.
Especially before Judge James Boasberg who is thousands of miles away in Washington D.C.
Despite the lack of standing and the case being filed in the wrong venue, Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court, not only blocked the deportation of all gang members back to Venezuela, but ordered that planes currently over international airspace that were carrying gang members turn around and bring them back to the United States.
Boasberg fumed that the planes were not turned around on his mere word and threatened the Justice Department with repercussions for not recognizing his power over not only the entire country, but also the entire planet.
But why was a judge from the D.C. Circuit Court on a case involving inmates in Texas?
The answer is that leftist organizations and the judges of the D.C. Circuit Court were using one weird trick to seize power over the entire country (if not always the planet) and transform themselves into a shadow government able to block any Trump administration move.
The Supreme Court’s ruling vacating Boasberg’s order stated that, “the detainees are confined in Texas, so venue is improper in the District of Columbia” and directed that the appropriate “venue lies in the district of confinement”. So how did a D.C. judge ever get involved at all?
In Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s concurrence he noted that the “only question is where that judicial review should occur. That venue question turns on whether these transfer claims belong in habeas corpus proceedings or instead may be brought under the Administrative Procedure Act.” The Supreme Court’s ruling even noted that “initially the detainees sought relief in habeas among other causes of action, but they dismissed their habeas claims” and stated that “their claims fall within the ‘core’ of the writ of habeas corpus and thus must be brought in habeas.”
Kavanaugh then laid out a brief history of detainees, including those terrorists at Gitmo, bringing claims under habeas corpus rather than, strangely, under the Administrative Procedure Act.
The Administrative Procedure Act had been created in response to the rise of a vast unaccountable government bureaucracy under FDR. The APA was supposed to stop the administrative state from turning into exactly the kind of self-governing machine it grew into which FDR had described as threatening to “develop a fourth branch of government for which there is no sanction in the Constitution.” It was not meant to block presidents from executing their policies or subject every one of those policies to the review of the D.C. Circuit Court.
The D.C. Circuit Court however has enabled every leftist ‘resistance’ group to go ‘judge shopping’ and file APA complaints to block anything and everything President Trump does.

And Judge Boasberg went ahead and tried to seize control of U.S. forces abroad from President Trump in the name of an act meant to regulate agencies.

      <contentSnippet>Miami Housing Market Hit By &quot;Breathtaking&quot; Collapse In Demand

            
Nick Gerli, CEO and Founder of real estate analytics firm Reventure Consulting, has issued another troubling update on Florida&apos;s housing market—this time sounding the alarm about a collapse in demand across the Miami metro area. He described the plunge in sales as &quot;breathtaking.&quot;

According to the Reventure app, prices across Miami-Dade County are 20.3% overvalued.

He warned: &quot;The more overvalued prices are, the greater the risk of downturns.&quot;

You can see Miami went through an epic downturn in the last crash, when prices actually became 33% undervalued.

Separately, and more broadly, the US housing inventory for new homes has hit its highest level since 2007.



What could possibly go wrong in an oversupplied housing market, with 30-year fixed mortgage rates hovering around 7%?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A county judge in New Mexico has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abqjournal.com/news/article_47926b51-d481-4aa9-8d76-5de8cc13809b.html&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; resigned after Homeland Security Investigations agents arrested a suspected &lt;a href=&quot;https://headlineusa.com/tag/tren-de-aragua&quot;&gt;Tren de Aragua&lt;/a&gt; gang member and other illegal aliens at his home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resignation of Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano comes after HSI agents executed a search warrant at his home on Feb. 28—arresting suspected 23-year-old gang member Cristhian Ortega-Lopez there. Agents also took an undisclosed number of other illegal immigrants into custody, and seized four firearms that he handled illegally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of Ortega-Lopez’s case are wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to court records, the suspected Tren de Aragua member was arrested while entering the U.S. illegally on Dec. 15, 2023. Due to overcrowded Border Patrol facilities, Ortega-Lopez was released three days later.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;This is absolutely bonkers: It looks like the judge&apos;s wife disclosed that the Tren de Aragua member was living with them -- and she seemingly discloses multiples crimes, including that he worked illegally and crossed the border 5 times in recent months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ortega-Lopez was supposed to stay in Denver pending removal proceedings. However, he moved to El Paso, Texas, without informing Homeland Security or any other government agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was in El Paso where Ortega-Lopez met Nancy Cano, the wife of Judge Cano.&lt;/strong&gt; The Canos admitted they hired Ortega-Lopez to install a glass door for them—which is illegal since the Venezuelan was not authorized to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ortega-Lopez was evicted from his apartment last April, after which he moved in with the Canos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The suspected Tren de Aragua member’s relationship with the Canos became cozy, so much so that he was introduced to their daughter, April Cano, who let him use her guns—which, like him working without authorization, is illegal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for the Canos, Ortega-Lopez posted pictures of himself with those firearms on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story became arguably even stranger after the HSI agents executed the Feb. 28 search warrant. On March 13, Nancy Cano wrote to U.S. Judge Damian Martinez, pleading for him to have mercy on Ortega-Lopez. In that letter, Cano seemingly admits that she illegally hired the immigrant—and also hired him out to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Each job he got I was told he did an excellent job. No one was ever disappointed. I started to receive more requests for him to return or referral for more jobs,” she said, also enclosing pictures of Ortega-Lopez with the Cano family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“On five different occasions he went through Border Patrol check points with no problems,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;she added—perhaps disclosing yet more crimes. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I took him in as my own son … Please consider his future and give him a chance.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a court hearing the next day, U.S. Judge Damian Martinez asked Justice Department prosecutor Maria Armijio if she knew Judge Cano. When the prosecutor said she didn’t know Judge Cano, Martinez said he did know him—and trusted him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve met him before several times and he’s got a BS meter like you – a lot of people have never seen. He knows when somebody is BS’ing him,” Judge Martinez said. “I don’t think Judge Cano has a BS meter and I don’t think he would just let anybody live in his property.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Martinez found that Ortega-Lopez was not a flight risk, and ordered him to be released. The DOJ appealed on March 28, disclosing more information about Ortega-Lopez’s relationship with the Canos, as well as his affiliation with Tren de Aragua. &lt;/strong&gt;According to the DOJ, agents found ample evidence of his gang affiliation while searching his cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A search of the cellphones revealed the following, which affirms the fact that the Defendant is a TdA member: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;(1) A conversation with an individual on April 30, 2024, in which he refers to his AK-47 tattoo as an ‘Aragua train,’ and comments that he is worried about telling [Nancy Cano] about it,” the DOJ said in its March 28 appeal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“(2) A conversation with an individual in which they discuss the $5,000 award offered by the State of Texas for TdA members and joke about the reward money,” the DOJ’s appeal added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“(3) A conversation with an individual in which the other participant warns Defendant about sending photographs that may jeopardize him in the United States that also includes a request to get a grenade or two 38s.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agents also allegedly found photographs of two brutal murder victims that includes mutilated bodies, decapitated heads and dismembered hands on Ortega-Lopez’s cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hearing is schedule for April 30 for Judge Martinez to reconsider allowing Ortega-Lopez to remain free on bail. The Canos have reportedly declined to comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Democrat Judge Caught Harboring Suspected Tren de Aragua Gang Member

A county judge in New Mexico has reportedly resigned after Homeland Security Investigations agents arrested a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member and other illegal aliens at his home.

Ortega-Lopez was supposed to stay in Denver pending removal proceedings. However, he moved to El Paso, Texas, without informing Homeland Security or any other government agency.

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Salvaror&apos;s President Nayib Bukele has offered to swap 252 Venezuelans deported to his country for &quot;political prisoners&quot; held by Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Combo-Bukele-Maduro-El-Salvador-Venezuela-EFE-.jpg?itok=HQBn4uUt&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Combo-Bukele-Maduro-El-Salvador-Venezuela-EFE-.jpg?itok=HQBn4uUt&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;c0c3622d-9a7a-4f7f-a862-d1891d59b566&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Combo-Bukele-Maduro-El-Salvador-Venezuela-EFE-.jpg?itok=HQBn4uUt&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bukele has agreed to hold deportees from the US in a maximum-security prison known as CECOT in exchange for payment - currently reported at around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-human-rights-law-likely-violated-6m-payment-el-salvador-prison-experts-say&quot;&gt;$6 million&lt;/a&gt; and growing. The Trump administration on March 15 sent 261 suspected illegal alien gang members to CECOT under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and has sent roughly 30 more since then, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration alleges that the deported Venezuelan illegals belong to criminal gangs, including Tren de Aragua, which he deemed a terrorist organization earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Bukele &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/nayibbukele/status/1914070199659098258&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on X that the 252 Venezuelans could be sent to Venezuela in exchange for the same number of &quot;political prisoners&quot; held by the Maduro government under a &quot;humanitarian agreement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Your political prisoners haven’t committed any crime,&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Nicolas Maduro, you have said on numerous occasions that you want the Venezuelans back and free,&quot; reads the post. &quot;Unlike you, who have political prisoners, we don&apos;t have political prisoners. All the Venezuelans we have in custody were detained as part of an operation against gangs like the Tren de Aragua in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unlike our detainees, many of whom have committed murder, others have committed rape, and some have even been arrested multiple times before being deported, &lt;strong&gt;your political prisoners have committed no crime. The only reason they are imprisoned is because they opposed you and your electoral fraud.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that includes &lt;strong&gt;the repatriation of 100% of the 252 Venezuelans&lt;/strong&gt; who were deported, in exchange for the release and delivery of an identical number (252) of the thousands of political prisoners that you hold,&quot; Bukele continued (translated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Maduro accepts the deal, it could ease political pressure on the Trump administration, which has been accused of denying due process to illegals and was temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court on Saturday from further deportations under the 18th century law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal comes after &lt;strong&gt;US Democrats dropped everything to demand the return of a &apos;wrongly deported&apos; El Salvadoran national living in the US illegally, Kilmar Abrego Garcia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>El Salvador Offers To Swap Venezuelans Deported From US For Political Prisoners Held By Venezuela

            
El Salvaror&apos;s President Nayib Bukele has offered to swap 252 Venezuelans deported to his country for &quot;political prisoners&quot; held by Venezuela.



Bukele has agreed to hold deportees from the US in a maximum-security prison known as CECOT in exchange for payment - currently reported at around $6 million and growing. The Trump administration on March 15 sent 261 suspected illegal alien gang members to CECOT under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and has sent roughly 30 more since then, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
The Trump administration alleges that the deported Venezuelan illegals belong to criminal gangs, including Tren de Aragua, which he deemed a terrorist organization earlier this year.
On Sunday, Bukele wrote on X that the 252 Venezuelans could be sent to Venezuela in exchange for the same number of &quot;political prisoners&quot; held by the Maduro government under a &quot;humanitarian agreement.&quot;
&quot;Your political prisoners haven’t committed any crime,&quot; he wrote.
&quot;Mr. Nicolas Maduro, you have said on numerous occasions that you want the Venezuelans back and free,&quot; reads the post. &quot;Unlike you, who have political prisoners, we don&apos;t have political prisoners. All the Venezuelans we have in custody were detained as part of an operation against gangs like the Tren de Aragua in the United States.
&quot;Unlike our detainees, many of whom have committed murder, others have committed rape, and some have even been arrested multiple times before being deported, your political prisoners have committed no crime. The only reason they are imprisoned is because they opposed you and your electoral fraud.
&quot;I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that includes the repatriation of 100% of the 252 Venezuelans who were deported, in exchange for the release and delivery of an identical number (252) of the thousands of political prisoners that you hold,&quot; Bukele continued (translated).
If Maduro accepts the deal, it could ease political pressure on the Trump administration, which has been accused of denying due process to illegals and was temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court on Saturday from further deportations under the 18th century law.
The proposal comes after US Democrats dropped everything to demand the return of a &apos;wrongly deported&apos; El Salvadoran national living in the US illegally, Kilmar Abrego Garcia. 



Garcia, whose wife issued a restraining order for domestic violence, was issued a deportation order and was later given a &quot;withholding of removal&quot; status due to danger he faced from a &apos;rival gang&apos; if he returned to El Salvador.



Last week, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador after Bukele refused to cooperate with an order by the US Supreme Court instructing the Trump administration to &quot;facilitate&quot; the return of Abrego Garcia.
According to Venezuelan rights group Foro Penal, there are 903 political prisoners being held by Maduro, including protesters and opposition leaders. Among the political prisoners Bukele mentioned is the son-in-law of former diplomat Edmundo González, who ran against Maduro and is considered by some allies of Washington to have won the election.

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The U.S. move to penalize China-built and China-owned vessels calling at U.S. ports&lt;/strong&gt; could lead to an oil supertanker made in China and operated by a Chinese company facing a fee of up to $5.2 million per call at a U.S. port, shipbrokers have estimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://ustr.gov/about/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2025/april/ustr-section-301-action-chinas-targeting-maritime-logistics-and-shipbuilding-sectors-dominance&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; fees on vessel owners and operators of China based on net tonnage per U.S. voyage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous proposal was a per-port-entry fee of up to $1.5 million on Chinese-built vessels, and up to a $1 million per-port-entry fee on any vessel (Chinese-built or non-Chinese-built) for operators that have any Chinese-built vessels in their fleet or orderbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) plans to impose fees on operators of Chinese-built ships based on net tonnage or containers, increasing incrementally over the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the new USTR move, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said, “Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The Trump administration’s actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the U.S. supply chain, and send a demand signal for U.S.-built ships,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Greer added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the new plan, the fee on a China-made China-operated supertanker could reach up to $5.2 million per call because of the large tonnage of the supertankers compared to smaller oil tankers, according to the research arm of Arrow Shipbroking Group cited by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-21/china-owned-supertankers-face-5-2-million-in-fees-per-us-call?embedded-checkout=true&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The previous per-call only fee would have charged up to $3.5 million for a tanker to call at a U.S. port.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil traders have already started to &lt;a href=&quot;https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Traders-Shun-Chinese-Tankers-as-Trump-Prepares-Port-Fees.html&quot;&gt;avoid hiring tankers&lt;/a&gt; built in China amid concerns that port fees could be coming for Chinese vessels at U.S. ports as part of a plan by President Donald Trump to revitalize the American shipbuilding industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oil traders and charterers that are booking vessels to call, load, or discharge cargoes at U.S. ports are seeking vessels not built in China, &lt;/strong&gt;market sources told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-03/oil-traders-shun-china-made-ships-for-us-flows-on-trump-levies&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

The U.S. is introducing fees on operators of China-built vessels calling at U.S. ports.
These fees could reach up to $5.2 million per call for large supertankers.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;&quot;He Who Has The Gold Makes The Rules&quot; President Trump Proclaims Over Easter Weekend&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many are still wondering about whether or not the audit of Fort Knox is happening, it doesn&apos;t seem like President Trump doubts the country&apos;s gold holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With gold surging through $3420/oz. for the first time ever this morning, many are pointing back to one of President Trump&apos;s Truth Social posts from yesterday. Trump wrote on Easter: &quot;THE GOLDEN RULE OF NEGOTIATING AND SUCCESS: HE WHO HAS THE GOLD MAKES THE RULES. THANK YOU!&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall, in early 2025, Donald Trump and Elon Musk publicly questioned whether Fort Knox still holds its gold reserves. Trump announced plans to visit the site, while Musk suggested a live-streamed inspection, saying, “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20at%209.26.51%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?itok=9KuQfSdy&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20at%209.26.51%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?itok=9KuQfSdy&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;8bf0f10d-ccb0-4984-9240-fc8b4e4480f0&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;187&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20at%209.26.51%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?itok=9KuQfSdy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent then responded by citing a 2024 audit confirming the presence of 147.3 million ounces of gold, with no major withdrawals in years. He added that senators can request a tour through his office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we&apos;ve laid out a number of reasons we think gold is surging in our article out this morning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/market-recaps/us-stock-futures-dollar-treasuries-tumble-powell-punt-panic-gold-bitcoin-soar&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;in a sign that investors are rotating investments away from the US, Deutsche Bank AG said that Chinese clients have reduced some of their Treasuries holdings in favor of European debt. European high-quality bonds, Japanese government bonds and gold are likely to be the potential choices for investors as alternatives to Treasuries, said Lillian Tao, head of China macro and global emerging market sales at the bank,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/market-recaps/us-stock-futures-dollar-treasuries-tumble-powell-punt-panic-gold-bitcoin-soar&quot;&gt;we wrote earlier this morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there was no specific catalyst for the suddenly collapse in the illiquid early Asian session, which saw many countries on extended Easter holiday, Bloomberg quoted traders that hedge funds are selling the dollar against virtually any currencies after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that President Donald Trump is still exploring ways to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The president and his team will continue to study that,” National Economic Council Director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-18/trump-studying-whether-removing-powell-is-option-hassett-says&quot;&gt;Kevin Hassett said Friday&lt;/a&gt; when asked by a reporter if removing Powell was an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hassett then suggested, accurately, that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The policy of this Federal Reserve was to raise rates the minute President Trump was elected last time, to say that the supply-side tax cuts that were going to be inflationary,” Hassett said, adding that Fed officials opted not to go “on TV and at IMF meetings and warn about the terrible inflation from the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden, and the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden was textbook inflationary,” Hassett continued. “And then they cut rates right ahead of the election.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>&quot;He Who Has The Gold Makes The Rules&quot; President Trump Proclaims Over Easter Weekend

            
While many are still wondering about whether or not the audit of Fort Knox is happening, it doesn&apos;t seem like President Trump doubts the country&apos;s gold holdings.
With gold surging through $3420/oz. for the first time ever this morning, many are pointing back to one of President Trump&apos;s Truth Social posts from yesterday. Trump wrote on Easter: &quot;THE GOLDEN RULE OF NEGOTIATING AND SUCCESS: HE WHO HAS THE GOLD MAKES THE RULES. THANK YOU!&quot;. 
Recall, in early 2025, Donald Trump and Elon Musk publicly questioned whether Fort Knox still holds its gold reserves. Trump announced plans to visit the site, while Musk suggested a live-streamed inspection, saying, “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not.”



Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent then responded by citing a 2024 audit confirming the presence of 147.3 million ounces of gold, with no major withdrawals in years. He added that senators can request a tour through his office.
Meanwhile, we&apos;ve laid out a number of reasons we think gold is surging in our article out this morning here. 
&quot;in a sign that investors are rotating investments away from the US, Deutsche Bank AG said that Chinese clients have reduced some of their Treasuries holdings in favor of European debt. European high-quality bonds, Japanese government bonds and gold are likely to be the potential choices for investors as alternatives to Treasuries, said Lillian Tao, head of China macro and global emerging market sales at the bank,&quot; we wrote earlier this morning.



While there was no specific catalyst for the suddenly collapse in the illiquid early Asian session, which saw many countries on extended Easter holiday, Bloomberg quoted traders that hedge funds are selling the dollar against virtually any currencies after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that President Donald Trump is still exploring ways to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to traders.
“The president and his team will continue to study that,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday when asked by a reporter if removing Powell was an option.
Hassett then suggested, accurately, that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats.
“The policy of this Federal Reserve was to raise rates the minute President Trump was elected last time, to say that the supply-side tax cuts that were going to be inflationary,” Hassett said, adding that Fed officials opted not to go “on TV and at IMF meetings and warn about the terrible inflation from the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden, and the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden was textbook inflationary,” Hassett continued. “And then they cut rates right ahead of the election.”

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador, the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is working with the computer chip giant Nvidia to implement artificial intelligence for national development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador signed a letter of intent to collaborate with Nvidia on “sovereign AI to drive innovation and economic growth,” the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) of El Salvador &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/bitcoinofficesv/status/1914288066056904796&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on X on April 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the collaboration, El Salvador will benefit from Nvidia’s AI tools, resources and expertise, enabling the development of sovereign AI capabilities targeting priorities related to culture, language, environment and economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“El Salvador will focus on building domestic AI infrastructure, upskilling the workforce, and creating solutions to address local challenges such as improving healthcare delivery, advancing education, and boosting economic productivity,” the announcement said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AI training for state officials and developers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador’s latest collaboration with Nvidia marks the country’s commitment to encouraging AI usage to optimize multiple processes within the government and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its new AI push, El Salvador intends to establish AI training programs for developers, researchers and government officials to “ensure the nation has the talent to sustain its AI ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has confirmed the end of its 30-hour Easter truce, which reportedly had some success as areas across the frontlines saw &lt;strong&gt;guns and shelling fall silent &lt;/strong&gt;for the first time in well over three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday the Kremlin acknowledged that &lt;strong&gt;military action has resumed&lt;/strong&gt;, and also emphasized again that the ceasefire which began Saturday evening was indicative of its attitude that it is indeed open to any peace initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Our attitude to ceasefires is positive&lt;/strong&gt;, and that is why we proposed the initiative, especially as it was during the holy Easter days,&quot; Putin had said of the special holiday weekend truce. &quot;We’ve seen the initial reaction [from Kiev], as I believe everyone did. The statement characterized our proposal as ‘playing with lives’ and so on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky had quickly accused Putin of not being genuine, and suggested it was a PR move intended to signal the Trump administration. &quot;As of Easter morning, we can say that the Russian army is trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places, it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine,&quot; he had posted on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are &lt;strong&gt;only interested in favorable PR coverage&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; Zelensky wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Putin had pointed out, &quot;Apparently, smarter people – probably foreign handlers – explained that refusing such a proposal is a losing proposition for the Kiev regime, and [the Ukrainians] swiftly agreed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has also shot back in fresh Monday statements that Zelensky was &lt;strong&gt;&quot;ready to reject Easter ceasefire — until his Western curators reminded him it&apos;s bad PR to oppose peace outright.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has meanwhile &lt;strong&gt;proposed extending the truce for 30 days&lt;/strong&gt; after it ended midnight Sunday, resulting in the Kremlin saying it is studying the possibility. Putin has since said he is &lt;strong&gt;reviewing a Ukrainian proposal for each side to case attacks on any civilian infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Putin has made clear that he&apos;s not interested in a merely temporary solution, but wants to achieve something lasing, on fears that Ukraine would just use a 30-day window to rearm and regroup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russian state media has published footage showing that during the Easter truce there was &lt;strong&gt;some positive, peaceful engagement among some troops on the ground&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/divisions-remain-as-republicans-steam-ahead-with-big-beautiful-bill-what-to-know-5844985?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Jackson Richman, Arjun Singh, and Joseph Lord via The Epoch Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Republicans barrel full steam ahead with President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” several divisions over components of the package linger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2896%29_5.jpg?itok=HR6qv6Ln&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2896%29_5.jpg?itok=HR6qv6Ln&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;3062b4a1-329e-489f-84ea-45af3dfefa24&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2896%29_5.jpg?itok=HR6qv6Ln&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, both chambers approved a budget blueprint that resulted from weeks of negotiations between the House and Senate, unlocking the reconciliation process being used to pass the package. In the coming weeks, the difficult work of passing Trump’s legislative agenda begins in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dubbed the “one, big, beautiful bill” by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), it is expected to consist of measures related to tax cuts, America’s energy sector, and securing the border.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reconciliation bill, it would be immune from the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate—but only if House Republicans can agree on a package first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Republicans’ narrow majority in the lower chamber—&lt;strong&gt;Johnson can spare no more than three defections&lt;/strong&gt;—passing this package will be a herculean task for leadership. Johnson will need to keep both moderates and conservatives happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about the lingering disputes as Republicans move forward with drafting the text of their bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Border Security, Energy, and Defense&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core components of the Republican budget proposal unveiled by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)—bolstering border security, funding energy expansion, and new defense appropriations—are generally non-controversial with broad swaths of Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In line with his chief policy priority during the 2024 presidential election, Trump and Republicans have sought to implement sweeping changes to how immigration and border security are handled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That includes both ongoing efforts to stem the flow of illegal immigrants across the U.S. southern border with Mexico and what Trump has promised will be the “largest deportation operation in American history.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding will target increased deportation-related detentions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Immigration Court hearings, and removal operations. Beyond removals, the Trump administration is pursuing the finalized construction of a border wall between the United States and Mexico, Trump’s main campaign promise in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has told The Epoch Times that he seeks to have his state “reimbursed” for its ongoing border security efforts under “Operation Lone Star” run by Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Texas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“[I want some] reimbursing [of] the State of Texas for the billions they’ve spent dealing with Joe Biden and the Democrats’ failure to secure the border,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Cruz told The Epoch Times on March 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the package will include new funding for energy and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump and his allies have been outspoken about their support of enhancing U.S. drilling, fracking, and natural gas extraction. During the 2024 election, Trump summarized his position as “Drill, baby, drill.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s argued that new and renewable energy sources should be used alongside traditional fossil fuel-based infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While policy changes in a reconciliation bill are restricted under the rules of the process, Republicans are sure to pursue an increase in energy production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current budget blueprint additionally instructs the House and Senate to allocate an additional $100 billion and $150 billion, respectively, toward defense over a decade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aspects of the bill are among the least controversial with Republicans. Some other components will be a tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tax Cuts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centerpiece of the Senate’s budget blueprint, which has since been approved by the House, is its plan to make permanent the personal income tax cuts first authorized by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The GOP proposal comes out to a top-line cost of around $4.5 trillion in lost potential tax revenue for the government.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without congressional action, those cuts will expire at the end of 2025 and rates will increase—a potential political nightmare for Republicans at the ballot box in 2026 if the issue isn’t addressed before Tax Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to implement these new rates permanently, Republicans must comply with the Byrd Rule, a rule governing the reconciliation process, which requires that any policy that impacts the deficit beyond ten years must be sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This could face challenges in both the House and Senate, however. Without steep spending cuts alongside these tax cuts, critics fear that the deficit could balloon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lower chamber, many lawmakers—such as budget hawks like Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), and members of the House Freedom Caucus—have expressed these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the House budget instructions currently call for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts—already a difficult ask—conservatives have indicated they won’t support any package that comes in at less than $2 trillion in cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But such steep cuts could equally alienate the moderate wing of the GOP: members like Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) and fellow purple district Republicans in California and New York have sought assurance that these spending cuts won’t harm key entitlements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threading the needle between these competing impulses will be challenging for leadership.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Medicaid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The budget resolution instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to cut $880 billion in spending over a decade, an amount that critics suspect will result in reductions to Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is Democrats’ main rallying point against the proposal, with several arguing that Republicans are planning to “gut Medicaid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson has said there will be no substantive cuts, but will only target waste, fraud, and abuse in the program. Trump has also expressed clear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/fact-check-president-trump-will-always-protect-social-security-medicare/&quot;&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt; to making any substantive cuts to the entitlement program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There are a lot of Americans who rely upon those—those programs, and we’ve got to ensure that they’re safeguarded,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; said Johnson on Fox News on April 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Johnson argued that there’s abuse in the program that can be rooted out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you have people on the program that are draining the resources, it takes it away from the people that are actually needing it the most and are intended to receive it. You’re talking about young single mothers down on their fortunes at the moment, the people with the real disabilities, the elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least 12 Republicans have come out against Medicaid cuts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Balancing the federal budget must not come at the expense of those who depend on these benefits for their health and economic security,” they wrote in an April 14 letter to Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Debt Ceiling Increase&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The budget resolution also calls for the House to increase the nation’s borrowing limit by $4 trillion and the Senate by $5 trillion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senate figure has come under fire by conservatives in the House such as members of the Freedom Caucus. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) initially told The Epoch Times that the budget resolution was “DEAD ON ARRIVAL” in the House, though he eventually voted for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debt ceiling is set to be reached within the next few months, though the exact timing is uncertain. Were the limit to not be lifted, the United States could go into default for the fifth time in its history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The debt limit has usually been increased on a bipartisan basis as it last was in 2023. However, by raising it without Democrat support, the GOP is looking to do so by pairing it with significant fiscal measures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the issue could still divide the two chambers, as the Senate seeks a greater debt limit bump than many House conservatives can stomach in the final package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumer Sentiment and Stock Prices were the biggest negative contributors&lt;/strong&gt;, while Building Permits and Jobless Claims were the biggest positive contributors...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/bfmCC63.jpg?itok=e9tMD3Gt&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/bfmCC63.jpg?itok=e9tMD3Gt&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;33390d9b-c888-424d-9fab-6a237c9d0ed6&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;121&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/bfmCC63.jpg?itok=e9tMD3Gt&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The US LEI for March pointed to slowing economic activity ahead,” said Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, Senior Manager, Business Cycle Indicators, at The Conference Board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;That said, the data does not suggest that a recession has begun or is about to start.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still, the Conference Board downwardly revised our US GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 1.6%, which is somewhat below the economy’s potential. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The slower projected growth rate reflects the impact of deepening trade wars, which may result in higher inflation, supply chain disruptions, less investing and spending, and a weaker labor market.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LEI’s six-month growth rate ticked down in March, but &lt;strong&gt;remained well above the recession threshold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-21_07-10-53.jpg?itok=AX-lrN7y&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-21_07-10-53.jpg?itok=AX-lrN7y&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;7e36d8bc-5dfa-4298-8c53-86d94f8b8360&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-21_07-10-53.jpg?itok=AX-lrN7y&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the economy is doomed (ish) because stocks and sentiment are down... because investors are pricing in a doomed economy...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perhaps the word &apos;leading&apos; in this index is misleading...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Sentiment &amp; Stock Prices Spark Biggest Plunge In US Leading Economic Indicators In 17 Months

            
Since December&apos;s Trump-optimism-driven surge in Leading Economic Indicators (the first since last February), The Conference Board&apos;s headline index has decelerated rapidly with March data released today plunging 0.7% MoM - the biggest drop since October 2023...



Consumer Sentiment and Stock Prices were the biggest negative contributors, while Building Permits and Jobless Claims were the biggest positive contributors...



That dragged the total index level down to its lowest since October 2016...



“The US LEI for March pointed to slowing economic activity ahead,” said Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, Senior Manager, Business Cycle Indicators, at The Conference Board.
&quot;That said, the data does not suggest that a recession has begun or is about to start. 
Still, the Conference Board downwardly revised our US GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 1.6%, which is somewhat below the economy’s potential. 
The slower projected growth rate reflects the impact of deepening trade wars, which may result in higher inflation, supply chain disruptions, less investing and spending, and a weaker labor market.&quot;
The LEI’s six-month growth rate ticked down in March, but remained well above the recession threshold



So the economy is doomed (ish) because stocks and sentiment are down... because investors are pricing in a doomed economy...?
Perhaps the word &apos;leading&apos; in this index is misleading...

Earlier this year, he experienced a severe health crisis that resulted in over a month of hospitalization due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/medical/pope-franciss-condition-worsens-after-respiratory-crisis-vatican&quot;&gt;double pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2025-04/pope-francis-dies-on-easter-monday-aged-88.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the death of the 266th pope via this statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Dearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis. At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favor of the poorest and most marginalized. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vatican News provided more color on the Pope&apos;s deteriorating health leading up to his death on Easter Monday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pope was admitted to the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital on Friday, February 14, 2025, after suffering from a bout of bronchitis for several days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pope Francis&apos; clinical situation gradually worsened, and his doctors diagnosed bilateral pneumonia on Tuesday, February 18.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After 38 days in hospital, the late Pope returned to his Vatican residence at the Casa Santa Marta to continue his recovery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To his 1.3 billion followers, Francis signaled a more inclusive stance toward LGBTQ+ Catholics and advocated for open borders in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout his tenure (March 13, 2013 to April 21, 2025), Francis also spoke about multiple recurring themes, including compassion, humility, and advocacy. He told followers, &quot;My people are poor, and I am one of them.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance met with Francis to exchange Easter greetings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know you have not been feeling great, but it&apos;s good to see you in better health,&quot; Vance told the Pope, adding, &quot;Thank you for seeing me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Vatican News reports that Pope Francis died at the age of 88 at 7:35 a.m. local time (1:35 a.m. EST). Earlier this year, he experienced a severe health crisis that resulted in over a month of hospitalization due to double pneumonia.



Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, announced the death of the 266th pope via this statement:

The question is whether the cardinals who choose Francis&apos; successor will read the latest cultural shifts across the West and pick a more traditional pope or continue down the path of progressive inclusiveness.

On April 11, Goolsbee said, “It makes the Fed’s job harder if you get what is clearly a stagflationary shock. When both sides of our mandate start getting worse at the same time, there’s not a generic playbook that you turn to.” He also added, “How we respond to a stagflationary shock depends on which one’s worse, how long are they going to last, are higher prices transitory or permanent, on the growth side, is this a response to uncertainty or is this spiraling more into recession.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, April 22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Speech text is expected. On April 3, Jefferson said, “Labor market conditions have remained stable through February, and progress on inflation has eased, but the outlook is uncertain.” He also added, “These conditions led me to favor holding the policy rate constant at what I view as a moderately restrictive level.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09:30 AM Philadelphia Fed President Harker (FOMC non-voter) speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Philadelphia Fed President Patric Harker will participate in a fireside chat about how economic mobility impacts regional economies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;01:30 PM Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari (FOMC non-voter) speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari will participate in a moderated discussion at the US Chamber of Commerce Global Summit in Washington DC. Q&amp;A is expected. On March 26, Kashkari said, “It’s conceivable that the hit to confidence could be a bigger effect than the tariffs themselves, and that makes me nervous, but the good news is the hit to confidence could be restored quickly if there are resolutions of these trade uncertainties.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;02:30 PM Richmond Fed President Barkin (FOMC non-voter) speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will participate in a fireside chat at the RVA Big Dipper Innovation Summit in Richmond, Virginia. Q&amp;A is expected. On April 1, Barkin said, “So far, the tariffs that have been announced have been revised. I plan to give it some time to see if we can figure out what a stable policy regime is [for tariffs] and then we can start thinking more about monetary policy.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;04:00 PM Fed Governor Kugler speaks:&lt;/strong&gt; Fed Governor Adriana Kugler will speak on the transmission of monetary policy at the University of Minnesota School of Public Affairs. Q&amp;A is expected. On April 2, Kugler said, “Given the recent lack of progress on inflation, recent increases in inflation expectations, and upside risks associated with announced and prospective policy changes… I will support maintaining the current policy rate for as long as these upside risks to inflation continue, while economic activity and employment remain stable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, April 23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fed Governor Kugler speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Fed Governor Adriana Kugler will attend and give brief introductory remarks at a Mille Lacs tribal meeting. The exact meeting time is TBD.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09:00 AM Chicago Fed President Goolsbee (FOMC voter) speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee will give opening remarks at the Economic Mobility Summit hosted by the Philadelphia Fed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09:30 AM St. Louis Fed President Musalem (FOMC voter): &lt;/strong&gt;St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem will give opening remarks at a Fed Listens event. On April 11, Musalem said, “Changes in tariffs can have various direct and indirect effects on prices and economic activity, depending on how they are implemented and the extent of retaliation by trading partners.” He also noted, “The direct effects might have only a brief and limited impact on inflation, [but] indirect and second-round effects could have a more persistent impact.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09:35 AM Fed Governor Waller speaks: &lt;/strong&gt;Fed Governor Christopher Waller will give opening remarks at a Fed Listens event. On April 14, Waller said, “With large tariff increases, I would expect the U.S. economy to slow significantly later this year and this slower pace to continue into next year.” He also added, “If the slowdown is significant and even threatens a recession, then I would expect to favor cutting the FOMC&apos;s policy rate sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.”&lt;/li&gt;

Speech text and Q&amp;A are expected. On April 16, Hammack said, “Given the economy’s starting point, and with both sides of our mandate expected to be under pressure, there is a strong case to hold monetary policy steady in order to balance the risks coming from further elevated inflation and a slowing labor market.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, April 24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We forecast 0.2% declines in core capital goods orders and shipments, reflecting declines in the new orders and shipments components of manufacturing surveys in March.&lt;/li&gt;

Monday, April 21
There are no major economic data releases scheduled.
08:30 AM Chicago Fed President Goolsbee (FOMC voter) speaks:  Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee is scheduled to appear on CNBC. On April 11, Goolsbee said, “It makes the Fed’s job harder if you get what is clearly a stagflationary shock. When both sides of our mandate start getting worse at the same time, there’s not a generic playbook that you turn to.” He also added, “How we respond to a stagflationary shock depends on which one’s worse, how long are they going to last, are higher prices transitory or permanent, on the growth side, is this a response to uncertainty or is this spiraling more into recession.”
Tuesday, April 22
There are no major economic data releases scheduled.
09:00 AM Fed Vice Chair Jefferson speaks: Fed Vice Chair Phillip Jefferson will give a speech on economic mobility and the dual mandate at the Economic Mobility Summit hosted by the Philadelphia Fed. Speech text is expected. On April 3, Jefferson said, “Labor market conditions have remained stable through February, and progress on inflation has eased, but the outlook is uncertain.” He also added, “These conditions led me to favor holding the policy rate constant at what I view as a moderately restrictive level.”
09:30 AM Philadelphia Fed President Harker (FOMC non-voter) speaks: Philadelphia Fed President Patric Harker will participate in a fireside chat about how economic mobility impacts regional economies.
01:30 PM Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari (FOMC non-voter) speaks: Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari will participate in a moderated discussion at the US Chamber of Commerce Global Summit in Washington DC. Q&amp;A is expected. On March 26, Kashkari said, “It’s conceivable that the hit to confidence could be a bigger effect than the tariffs themselves, and that makes me nervous, but the good news is the hit to confidence could be restored quickly if there are resolutions of these trade uncertainties.”
02:30 PM Richmond Fed President Barkin (FOMC non-voter) speaks: Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will participate in a fireside chat at the RVA Big Dipper Innovation Summit in Richmond, Virginia. Q&amp;A is expected. On April 1, Barkin said, “So far, the tariffs that have been announced have been revised. I plan to give it some time to see if we can figure out what a stable policy regime is [for tariffs] and then we can start thinking more about monetary policy.”
04:00 PM Fed Governor Kugler speaks: Fed Governor Adriana Kugler will speak on the transmission of monetary policy at the University of Minnesota School of Public Affairs. Q&amp;A is expected. On April 2, Kugler said, “Given the recent lack of progress on inflation, recent increases in inflation expectations, and upside risks associated with announced and prospective policy changes… I will support maintaining the current policy rate for as long as these upside risks to inflation continue, while economic activity and employment remain stable.”
Wednesday, April 23
Fed Governor Kugler speaks: Fed Governor Adriana Kugler will attend and give brief introductory remarks at a Mille Lacs tribal meeting. The exact meeting time is TBD.

09:30 AM St. Louis Fed President Musalem (FOMC voter): St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem will give opening remarks at a Fed Listens event. On April 11, Musalem said, “Changes in tariffs can have various direct and indirect effects on prices and economic activity, depending on how they are implemented and the extent of retaliation by trading partners.” He also noted, “The direct effects might have only a brief and limited impact on inflation, [but] indirect and second-round effects could have a more persistent impact.”
09:35 AM Fed Governor Waller speaks: Fed Governor Christopher Waller will give opening remarks at a Fed Listens event. On April 14, Waller said, “With large tariff increases, I would expect the U.S. economy to slow significantly later this year and this slower pace to continue into next year.” He also added, “If the slowdown is significant and even threatens a recession, then I would expect to favor cutting the FOMC&apos;s policy rate sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.”

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Wedbush&apos;s Dan Ives Warns About &quot;Code Red&quot; Situation Unfolding At Tesla &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just weeks after Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives slashed his Tesla price target by 43%, citing a brand crisis fueled by CEO Elon Musk&apos;s involvement with DOGE, he&apos;s back with another warning about a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;code red&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; moment for the most American-made car brand—one day before its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; Ives penned in a note to clients on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla....and anyone that thinks the brand damage Musk has inflicted is not a real thing, spend some time speaking to car buyers in the US, Europe, and Asia. You will think differently after those discussions&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Ives, whose analyst rating on the stock remains &quot;Buy&quot; rated, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/wedbushs-daniel-ives-cuts-tesla-price-target-says-brand-has-morphed-political-symbol&quot;&gt;slashed his price target&lt;/a&gt; to $315, down from $550. He explained, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally, adding, &quot;It is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the analyst, Tesla faces &quot;&lt;strong&gt;potentially 15%-20% permanent demand destruction for future Tesla buyers due to the brand damage Musk has created with DOGE. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Yet we must point out that the Tesla protests were small-scale and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/political/tesla-takedown-organizers-plan-color-revolution-kill-brand-death-spiral-investors&quot;&gt;funded by corrupt NGOs&lt;/a&gt; connected with rogue billionaires and the Democratic Party. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news for Ives is that Musk is a special government employee with DOGE, a temporary federal employee who can only work 130 days a year. There are ways around extending SGE time, but a recent report from Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said Musk is expected to step back from his hole once the 130 days lapse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ives remained bullish on Tesla, calling the brand one of the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;most disruptive technology companies on the globe over the coming years&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; Yet he said Tesla needs its &quot;most important asset&quot;: Musk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Tesla will announce its earnings for the first quarter. From a delivery perspective, we already have a good idea about weak sales—that&apos;s because it releases delivery numbers for the quarter several weeks before it releases its full results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of April, Tesla &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/tesla-deliveries-tktktktk-draft-do-not-publish&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 330,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, missing Goldman, JPM, Morgan Stanley, and UBS&apos; estimates of between 351,000 and 375,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla shares have been halved since their record high on Dec. 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of the latest Wall Street consensus (data via Bloomberg), 54.1% of analysts covering Tesla maintain a &quot;Buy&quot; rating, 24.6% rate the stock as &quot;Hold,&quot; and 21.3% assign a &quot;Sell&quot; rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Snag_1a2fc9dc.png?itok=gYv_TK-k&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Snag_1a2fc9dc.png?itok=gYv_TK-k&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;f7c438b0-8655-4208-8fc2-e922700b33d4&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;402&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Snag_1a2fc9dc.png?itok=gYv_TK-k&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ives concluded, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;We view this as a fork in the road time: if Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage, but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; adding, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;If Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House, it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow.&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Wedbush&apos;s Dan Ives Warns About &quot;Code Red&quot; Situation Unfolding At Tesla 

            
Just weeks after Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives slashed his Tesla price target by 43%, citing a brand crisis fueled by CEO Elon Musk&apos;s involvement with DOGE, he&apos;s back with another warning about a &quot;code red&quot; moment for the most American-made car brand—one day before its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Klaus Schwab Steps Down From WEF Board Amid Globalist Retreat&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same day Pope Francis—known for his inclusive beliefs—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/pope-francis-dies-88&quot;&gt;passed away&lt;/a&gt;, another globalist fell: Klaus Schwab, the architect of the World Economic Forum&apos;s dystopian agenda, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/press/2025/04/world-economic-forum-announces-governance-transition/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; he was stepping down from the WEF board. It marks the end of an era for Schwab, who championed radical wokeness, bug eating, mass vaccination campaigns, population control, and climate de-growth policies through what often resembled digital communism—social credit scores, central bank digital currencies, and many more China-like policies. Meanwhile, cultural shifts across the Americas signal a rising movement toward traditional values, sending the WEF&apos;s ideological woke grip on governments, non-government organizations, corporations, the church, and society into disarray. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Following my recent announcement, and as I enter my 88th year, I have decided to step down from the position of Chair and as a member of the Board of Trustees, with immediate effect&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; Schwab wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/GpDLm6PXAAAJx7l.jpg?itok=XOyvofPt&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/GpDLm6PXAAAJx7l.jpg?itok=XOyvofPt&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;de6a6471-afd5-4154-a0cb-6e476561b8b1&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/GpDLm6PXAAAJx7l.jpg?itok=XOyvofPt&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwab stepped down as executive chairman one year ago (read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/wef-founder-klaus-schwab-stepping-down-executive-chairman&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), with former Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende taking over daily operations. WEF said Vice Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe was appointed board chairman in the interim and that a search committee for replacement had been appointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WEF stated: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At a time when the world is undergoing rapid transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the need for inclusive dialogue to navigate complexity and shape the future has never been more critical. The Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum underlines the importance of remaining steadfast in its mission and values as a facilitator of progress. Building on its trusted role, the Forum will continue to bring together leaders from all sectors and regions to exchange insights and foster collaboration.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might recognize some of the WEF&apos;s board members...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwab’s resignation also comes three months after President Trump told globalist CEOs at the WEF’s 2025 Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, “America is back.” It also follows Trump and Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative, which nuked USAID programs that funneled billions of taxpayer dollars into corrupt NGOs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Klaus Schwab Steps Down From WEF Board Amid Globalist Retreat

            
On the same day Pope Francis—known for his inclusive beliefs—passed away, another globalist fell: Klaus Schwab, the architect of the World Economic Forum&apos;s dystopian agenda, announced he was stepping down from the WEF board. It marks the end of an era for Schwab, who championed radical wokeness, bug eating, mass vaccination campaigns, population control, and climate de-growth policies through what often resembled digital communism—social credit scores, central bank digital currencies, and many more China-like policies. Meanwhile, cultural shifts across the Americas signal a rising movement toward traditional values, sending the WEF&apos;s ideological woke grip on governments, non-government organizations, corporations, the church, and society into disarray. 
&quot;Following my recent announcement, and as I enter my 88th year, I have decided to step down from the position of Chair and as a member of the Board of Trustees, with immediate effect,&quot; Schwab wrote in a statement. 



Schwab stepped down as executive chairman one year ago (read: here), with former Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende taking over daily operations. WEF said Vice Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe was appointed board chairman in the interim and that a search committee for replacement had been appointed.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Abrego Garcia Moved To Lower Security Detention Facility, Given Own Room: State Department&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/abrego-garcia-moved-to-el-salvador-detention-facility-given-own-room-state-department-5844955?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Aldgra Fredly via The Epoch Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant who was deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been transferred from the country’s maximum-security prison to a detention facility, where he now has his own room, according to an April 20 court filing by the U.S. State Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2894%29_5.jpg?itok=bfJcANvj&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2894%29_5.jpg?itok=bfJcANvj&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;21be3f76-a5c6-4799-9db0-2ff88f209660&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2894%29_5.jpg?itok=bfJcANvj&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, illegally entered the United States in 2011 and was living in Maryland. He was arrested and deported to El Salvador in March for allegedly being a member of the MS-13 gang, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, despite an immigration judge having issued a withholding of removal—which legally barred his deportation to his home country—in 2019 due to concerns for his safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department &lt;a href=&quot;https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815.92.0.pdf&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Abrego Garcia was transferred from El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) to a facility in Santa Ana eight days before he met with U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) on April 17 during the senator’s visit to the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Abrego Garcia told Sen. Van Hollen that he had been placed in the administrative building of Centro Industrial, in a room of his own with a bed and furniture, and that he was not in a cell,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Michael Kozak, a senior official at the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Van Hollen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/maryland-senator-describes-meeting-with-abrego-garcia-in-el-salvador-5844223&quot;&gt;traveled&lt;/a&gt; to El Salvador last week to visit Abrego Garcia after Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said the man would not be returned to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the United States after it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/doj-says-administrative-error-resulted-in-deportation-of-gang-member-5834805&quot;&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that he was deported following an administrative error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration has said that it lacked the authority to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador as he was already in the custody of a foreign nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to reporters on April 16, Van Hollen said the Salvadoran government initially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/maryland-senator-says-el-salvador-denied-him-meeting-phone-call-with-deported-man-5842982&quot;&gt;denied him a visit&lt;/a&gt; or phone call with Abrego Garcia after meeting with the country’s Vice President Félix Ulloa. That visit occurred the following day when Salvadoran officials transported the man to the hotel where Van Hollen was staying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The senator has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/maryland-senator-describes-meeting-with-abrego-garcia-in-el-salvador-5844223&quot;&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration of defying court orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“When you defy court orders and deny one man his Constitutional rights, you threaten them for ALL,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Van Hollen &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/1914016624828694990&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; on social media, adding that there was no evidence linking Abrego Garcia to the MS-13 gang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has criticized Democrats whom he said were falsely portraying Abrego Garcia as an innocent person, saying that two courts have found him to be a member of “the violent, killer gang MS-13.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Those lying to the American People on behalf of violent criminals have to be held responsible by the Agencies and the Courts,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Trump stated in a Truth Social &lt;a href=&quot;https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114372349322321344&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 18, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released documents detailing Abrego Garcia’s past encounters with law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the documents, Abrego Garcia was pulled over in Tennessee for speeding while carrying eight other individuals in a vehicle belonging to his employer in December 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No luggage was found in the vehicle. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the group’s three-day travel from Texas to Maryland “reek of human trafficking.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We hear far too much about the gang members and criminals’ false sob stories and not enough about their victims,” McLaughlin said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/04/18/dhs-releases-bombshell-investigative-report-kilmar-abrego-garcia-suspected-human&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Abrego Garcia was identified by the Prince George’s County Police Department’s gang unit as a member of the MS-13 gang. He was later granted withholding of removal by an immigration judge, according to the DHS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Abrego Garcia Moved To Lower Security Detention Facility, Given Own Room: State Department

            
Authored by Aldgra Fredly via The Epoch Times,
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant who was deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been transferred from the country’s maximum-security prison to a detention facility, where he now has his own room, according to an April 20 court filing by the U.S. State Department.



Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, illegally entered the United States in 2011 and was living in Maryland. He was arrested and deported to El Salvador in March for allegedly being a member of the MS-13 gang, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, despite an immigration judge having issued a withholding of removal—which legally barred his deportation to his home country—in 2019 due to concerns for his safety.
The department said Abrego Garcia was transferred from El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) to a facility in Santa Ana eight days before he met with U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) on April 17 during the senator’s visit to the country.
“Abrego Garcia told Sen. Van Hollen that he had been placed in the administrative building of Centro Industrial, in a room of his own with a bed and furniture, and that he was not in a cell,” Michael Kozak, a senior official at the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said in the filing.
Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week to visit Abrego Garcia after Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said the man would not be returned to the United States.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the United States after it acknowledged that he was deported following an administrative error.
The administration has said that it lacked the authority to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador as he was already in the custody of a foreign nation.
Speaking to reporters on April 16, Van Hollen said the Salvadoran government initially denied him a visit or phone call with Abrego Garcia after meeting with the country’s Vice President Félix Ulloa. That visit occurred the following day when Salvadoran officials transported the man to the hotel where Van Hollen was staying.
The senator has accused the Trump administration of defying court orders.
“When you defy court orders and deny one man his Constitutional rights, you threaten them for ALL,” Van Hollen stated on social media, adding that there was no evidence linking Abrego Garcia to the MS-13 gang.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.
President Donald Trump has criticized Democrats whom he said were falsely portraying Abrego Garcia as an innocent person, saying that two courts have found him to be a member of “the violent, killer gang MS-13.”
“Those lying to the American People on behalf of violent criminals have to be held responsible by the Agencies and the Courts,” Trump stated in a Truth Social post on Sunday.

On April 18, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released documents detailing Abrego Garcia’s past encounters with law enforcement.
According to the documents, Abrego Garcia was pulled over in Tennessee for speeding while carrying eight other individuals in a vehicle belonging to his employer in December 2022.
No luggage was found in the vehicle. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the group’s three-day travel from Texas to Maryland “reek of human trafficking.”
“We hear far too much about the gang members and criminals’ false sob stories and not enough about their victims,” McLaughlin said in a statement. Abrego Garcia was not charged in the incident.
In 2019, Abrego Garcia was identified by the Prince George’s County Police Department’s gang unit as a member of the MS-13 gang. He was later granted withholding of removal by an immigration judge, according to the DHS.

As of 8:00am ET, S&amp;P futures are down 1.3% and Nasdaq futures slide 1.5% with Mag7 names under pressure with INTC/NFLX among the bright spots in TMT. European stock markets were largely still shut for a public holiday. The dollar is set up to have its worst day in 2 weeks, plunging to a 15 month low, and sending precious metals soaring: gold was above $3400 at last check. Energy is weaker, Ags/base metals are higher. There is also trouble in trade deal  land with Japan pushing back on US demands for its trade deal, while China warns trading partners against mistreatment in any deal made with the US. It&apos;s a quiet day with just the Leading index on today&apos;s calendar (10am); Fed&apos;s Goolsbee speaks at 8:30am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/ES%202025-04-21_7-54-49.jpg?itok=H5T0tL-j&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ES%202025-04-21_7-54-49.jpg?itok=H5T0tL-j&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;d3abf334-7190-43af-a222-54515df39abd&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ES%202025-04-21_7-54-49.jpg?itok=H5T0tL-j&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In premarket trading, the Mag 7 are lower, with Tesla the top decliner: TSLA plunged 4% after Wedbush analyst and a Tesla bull Dan Ives warns of a “code red” moment ahead of first-quarter earnings (the rest are also hurting NVDA -3.1%, META -1.3%, AAPL -2%, AMZN -1.7%, GOOGL -1.3% and MSFT -0.9%). Netflix climbed 2.4% after the streaming giant reported record profit to start the year, allaying concerns of a slowdown or fears the streaming leader might be hurt by growing economic uncertainty. Here are some other notable movers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) rises 2.7% after receiving approval from US regulators to buy Discover Financial Services, a deal that creates the nation’s biggest credit-card issuer by loan volume. Discover (DFS) gains 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Salesforce (CRM) declines 1.5% after D.A. Davidson downgraded the software company, saying it’s neglecting its core business to pursue a “premature” AI opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Spotify (SPOT) climbs 1% after Wolfe Research upgraded its rating, saying there “multiple paths to improved monetization.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor ADRs (TSM) drop 1.9% after the company listed challenges of ensuring export control compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, rightfully frustrated that the central bank hasn’t moved to lower interest rates as even BofA&apos;s Michael Hartnett &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/hartnett-amid-apocalyptic-sentiment-bullish-roadmap-emerges&quot;&gt;noted over the weekend&lt;/a&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fed cut 50bps in Sept when stock market at record high, Atlanta Fed was forecasting +3% US GDP growth; Fed now determined not to cut rates after 20% market plunge, Atlanta Fed forecasting -3% GDP growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... posted on social media last week that Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough!” and on Friday, Trump top economic advisor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-18/trump-studying-whether-removing-powell-is-option-hassett-says&quot;&gt;Kevin Hassett said &lt;/a&gt;the president is studying whether he’s able to fire Powell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebuking the Fed undermines the principle of central bank independence and risks politicizing US monetary policy in a way that markets will find deeply unsettling, said Christopher Wong, a currency strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. “Frankly, firing Powell stretches belief,” said Wong. “If the credibility of the Fed is called into question, it could severely erode confidence in the dollar.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump would put the credibility of the dollar on the line and destabilize the US economy if he fired Powell, French Finance Minister Eric Lombard warned. Fed Chicago President Austan Goolsbee warned against efforts to curtail the central bank’s independence. “There’s virtual unanimity among economists that monetary independence from political interference, that the Fed or any central bank be able to do the job that it needs to do, is really important,” Goolsbee said on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sign that investors are rotating investments away from the US, Deutsche Bank AG said that Chinese clients have reduced some of their Treasuries holdings in favor of European debt. European high-quality bonds, Japanese government bonds and gold are likely to be the potential choices for investors as alternatives to Treasuries, said Lillian Tao, head of China macro and global emerging market sales at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tariff news, China’s largest shipping line, Cosco Shipping, said the US plans to impose levies on Chinese vessels docking at US ports would erode stability in global trade and supply chains. China has vowed to use its big market to help companies cope with “external shocks.” Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party is said to be set to make an emergency proposal in the wake of the US tariffs, urging the government to strengthen loan support for companies and boost domestic demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In FX, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slid 0.8% on Monday to a 9 month low, its worst day in 2 weeks. Every Group-of-10 currency gained against the greenback. The jump in the yen weighed on stock indexes in Japan, pushing the Nikkei 225 down 1.3%. The yen, euro and Swiss franc rallied. Brent fell as much as 2% to below $67 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rates, the Treasury yield curve steepened  with two-year notes rallying as longer maturities tumbled. That suggests investors are betting on the chance of interest rate cuts and reflecting concerns over long-term US assets. The Treasury curve pivots around a near unchanged 5-year sector, with the twist steepening move widening 2s10s, 5s30s spreads by 6.5bp and 6bp on the day, adding to Thursday’s steepening momentum. US 10-year yields trade around 4.40%, cheaper by 8bp vs. Thursday close. According to Bloomberg, price action continues around a narrative of declining dollar and US stock futures amid continued concerns that President Donald Trump will fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Added premium for Fed cuts seen in front-end, where swaps now price around 90bp of easing for the year vs. 85bp priced last week. European markets also shut for Easter Monday.  Treasury auctions resume Tuesday with $69 billion 2-year notes, followed by $70 billion 5-year and $44 billion 7-year Wednesday and Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In commodities, oil retreated as traders fretted over the impact of the US-led trade war on energy demand, while sings of progress in talks between Washington and Tehran eased concerns about supplies from Iran. WTI crude traded down 2.4% to $62.50, erasing much of Friday&apos;s gain. Meanwhile gold continues to print record highs, rising above $3400 amid collapsing confidence in fiat currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while gold&apos;s surge was to be expected, the most notable move overnight is that bitcoin finally snapped higher, breaking its recent correlation with the dollar (and inverse correlation with the yen due to its carry trade funding), and surged above $87,000, suggesting a sharp move higher in bitcoin may be imminent, especially once other central banks start easing to offset the collapse in the USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media that peddled the Russia hoax,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Hegseth said, responding to new reporting from The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Not gonna work with me. &lt;strong&gt;Because we’re changing the Defense Department. Putting the Pentagon back in the hands of warfighters.&lt;/strong&gt; And anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesn’t matter. So I’m happy to be here at the Easter Egg Roll with my dad and my kids.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Monday that the president “absolutely has confidence” in Hegseth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I spoke to him about it this morning, and he stands strongly behind him,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Leavitt said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the fake news refused to drop it and so conjured up a bullshit story that The White House has begun a search for a new SecDef (NPR reported, according to a person familiar). Leavitt was quick to destroy that narrative completely...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Administration officials have insisted there was no classified information shared in either chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*  *  *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is taking heavy fire once again.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In what looks like a coordinated attack&lt;/strong&gt;, Sunday brought a sensational new allegation of Hegseth violating operational security (OPSEC) ahead of the March 15 US strikes on Yemen, and an op-ed from a former Hegseth advocate calling for his removal over &quot;total chaos at the Pentagon.&quot; While it&apos;s hard to discern motives in DC&apos;s &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; intrigue, the renewed assault comes after &lt;strong&gt;Hegseth reportedly helped dissuade President Trump from launching Israel&apos;s long-pursued US war on Iran&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, Hegseth found himself in the middle of a media and political firestorm after &lt;strong&gt;he unwittingly shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-atlantic-war-plans-signal-yemen-houthis-c0addd08c627ab01a37ea63621cb695e&quot;&gt;detailed information&lt;/a&gt; about pending US strikes on Yemen with &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; editor Jeffrey Goldberg&lt;/strong&gt; -- who was errantly added to a Signal group chat for top officials by national security advisor Mike Waltz . Hegseth didn&apos;t do himself any favors by downplaying the report and attempting to obfuscate the facts of the scandal -- for example, using wordplay to claim &quot;nobody was texting war plans,&quot; but rather minute-by-minute details of the attack. Goldberg&apos;s inclusion aside, &lt;strong&gt;the use of a common smartphone app to discuss such sensitive details was controversial by itself&lt;/strong&gt;, raising concerns not only about OPSEC, but also records retention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to Sunday, when a double-tap attack on Hegseth&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;started with a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report that&lt;strong&gt; Hegseth shared substantially identical, advance details about the March 15 strikes with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/hegseth-yemen-attack-second-signal-chat.html&quot;&gt;a second Signal chat group&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-signal-chat-houthis-attack-8dbf9dd6c711796438a5c1c84831c40b&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; members included his wife Jennifer, brother Phil and personal lawyer Tim Parlatore&lt;/strong&gt;. Citing four sources familiar with this group chat and its contents, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/hegseth-yemen-attack-second-signal-chat.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that this group -- labelled &quot;Defense/Team Huddle&quot; -- was created by Hegseth himself, who accessed it with his private phone, not his government one.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While his personal lawyer and brother have DOD jobs, neither seemingly had a &quot;need to know&quot; about the attacks. Hegseth appointed Parlatore as a Navy Reserve JAG Commander, with a focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/05/us/trump-news?searchResultPosition=7#hegseths-personal-lawyer-to-be-commissioned-as-a-navy-commander-in-the-reserves&quot;&gt;improving the training&lt;/a&gt; of JAG officers. Phil Hegseth is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2025/03/28/hegseths-younger-brother-is-serving-in-a-key-role-inside-the-pentagon/&quot;&gt;DOD liaison with the Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; -- a post that hardly suggests a need to know about the imminent strike, much less a timeline &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-atlantic-war-plans-signal-yemen-houthis-c0addd08c627ab01a37ea63621cb695e&quot;&gt;detailing&lt;/a&gt; that F-18s, MQ-9 Reaper drones and Tomahawk cruise missiles would be used. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;strong&gt;this scenario seems to indicate a Secretary of Defense excitedly and unjustifiably sharing inside info with his wife and confidants&lt;/strong&gt;. Validating his confirmation-opponents&apos; attacks on his lack of experience, the decision seems consistent with a SecDef whose own top military rank was &lt;a href=&quot;https://ballotpedia.org/Pete_Hegseth&quot;&gt;Major&lt;/a&gt; in the National Guard. Meanwhile, the Signal chat about Yemen isn&apos;t the first time &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Hegseth&apos;s involvement in her husband&apos;s job has raised eyebrows&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/hegseth-brought-his-wife-to-sensitive-meetings-with-foreign-military-officials-c16db0ea&quot;&gt;Questions have also been raised over why Jennifer -- a former &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt; producer with no DOD job -- has participated in multiple meetings that covered sensitive topics&lt;/a&gt;, including one with the head of UK&apos;s military to discuss terminating the sharing of intelligence with Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/ullyot-hegseth.jpeg?itok=U5CzzD2i&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ullyot-hegseth.jpeg?itok=U5CzzD2i&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;5e3eb579-67b8-416f-bdbb-8122c1b76f04&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;318&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ullyot-hegseth.jpeg?itok=U5CzzD2i&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Ullyot -- who publicly advocated for Hegseth&apos;s confirmation -- now says Trump should dump him over Pentagon &quot;dysfunction&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second half of the weekend blitz against Hegseth came in the form of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/04/20/pentagon-chaos-ullyot-hegseth-00205594&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; op-ed written by John Ullyot&lt;/strong&gt;, a former champion of Hegseth who resigned from a Department of Defense public affairs role last month. He described the last month as &quot;total chaos at the Pentagon,&quot; saying that, given President Trump&apos;s &quot;strong record of holding his top officials to account...&lt;strong&gt;it’s hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role&lt;/strong&gt; for much longer.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the poor OPSEC of &quot;Signalgate&quot; and Hegseth&apos;s attempt to use a &quot;vague, Clinton-esque non-denial denial&quot; of the scandal, Hegseth focused on &lt;strong&gt;last week&apos;s firing of three top Pentagon staffers&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;senior adviser Dan Caldwell, deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick and chief of staff Colin Carroll. Ullyot wrote that Hegseth loyalists &quot;tried to smear the aides anonymously,&quot; dishonestly accusing them of leaking sensitive information. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Hegseth’s team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; wrote Ullyot. The &quot;strange and baffling purge&quot; is causing &quot;disarray,&quot; wrote Ullyot, who also called out the odd inclusion of Hegseth&apos;s wife in sensitive meetings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;The president deserves better than the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://jel.jewish-languages.org/words/382&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;mishegoss&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the Pentagon,&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;concluded Ullyot. &quot;Given his record of holding prior Cabinet leaders accountable, many in the secretary’s own inner circle will applaud quietly if Trump [fires Hegseth].&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No matter how much credence you attach to substance of these attacks on Hegseth, it&apos;s smart to consider the possible motives&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;of those who are participating in them:&lt;/strong&gt; the four people volunteering details about the newly-revealed Signal group chat, Hegseth cheerleader-turned-assailant John Ullyot, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and especially &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; -- an outlet with a record of advancing the Deep State agenda. (Never forget the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/hunter-biden-story-russian-disinfo-430276&quot;&gt;Oct 19 2020 &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; headline: &quot;Hunter Biden Story is Russian Disinfo, Dozens of Former Intel Officials Say.&quot;)   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On one front, Hegseth is going all-out on behalf of the national security apparatus&lt;/strong&gt;, joining Trump in a campaign to throw perhaps every dollar of DOGE savings into a Pentagon rathole in a bid to push the DOD budget beyond $1 trillion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;Hegseth may be an intolerable Deep State disappointment on a far more important front -- failing to deliver the US war on Iran that&apos;s been a decades-long ambition of the State of Israel &lt;/strong&gt;and its American collaborators. Last week, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-israel-iran-nuclear.html&quot;&gt;Trump killed an Israeli proposal for a US-facilitated, week-long IDF bombing campaign on Iranian nuclear facilities in May, attributing the decision to key naysayers that included Hegseth&lt;/a&gt;, Vice President JD Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. Contemplating the specter of such an attack sparking an all-out war, Trump opted to give diplomacy a chance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&apos;s the last thing many Deep State power brokers want.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>President Trump &quot;Stands Strongly Behind&quot; Hegseth; White House Denies NPR&apos;s &quot;Fake News&quot; Story On New SecDef Search

            
Update (1030ET): SecDef Hegseth is not taking these new allegations sitting down, lashing out at “disgruntled former employees” for leaks and reassuring that he and President Trump are “on the same page all the way.”
“What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media that peddled the Russia hoax,” Hegseth said, responding to new reporting from The New York Times.

“This is what the media does. They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations,” Hegseth continued.

Of course, the fake news refused to drop it and so conjured up a bullshit story that The White House has begun a search for a new SecDef (NPR reported, according to a person familiar). Leavitt was quick to destroy that narrative completely...
This ⁦@NPR⁩ story is total FAKE NEWS based on one anonymous source who clearly has no idea what they are talking about.

As the President said this morning, he stands strongly behind ⁦@SecDef⁩. https://t.co/5Npig8968v

Administration officials have insisted there was no classified information shared in either chat.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is taking heavy fire once again. In what looks like a coordinated attack, Sunday brought a sensational new allegation of Hegseth violating operational security (OPSEC) ahead of the March 15 US strikes on Yemen, and an op-ed from a former Hegseth advocate calling for his removal over &quot;total chaos at the Pentagon.&quot; While it&apos;s hard to discern motives in DC&apos;s House of Cards intrigue, the renewed assault comes after Hegseth reportedly helped dissuade President Trump from launching Israel&apos;s long-pursued US war on Iran. 
Last month, Hegseth found himself in the middle of a media and political firestorm after he unwittingly shared detailed information about pending US strikes on Yemen with Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg -- who was errantly added to a Signal group chat for top officials by national security advisor Mike Waltz . Hegseth didn&apos;t do himself any favors by downplaying the report and attempting to obfuscate the facts of the scandal -- for example, using wordplay to claim &quot;nobody was texting war plans,&quot; but rather minute-by-minute details of the attack. Goldberg&apos;s inclusion aside, the use of a common smartphone app to discuss such sensitive details was controversial by itself, raising concerns not only about OPSEC, but also records retention. 
Did civilian Jennifer Hegseth have a need to know the 1st strike package of F-18s would launch at 12:15 ET on March 15, and that &quot;THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP&quot; AT 1415, as Hegseth texted her and his brother? 


Fast-forward to Sunday, when a double-tap attack on Hegseth started with a New York Times report that Hegseth shared substantially identical, advance details about the March 15 strikes with a second Signal chat group, whose 13 members included his wife Jennifer, brother Phil and personal lawyer Tim Parlatore. Citing four sources familiar with this group chat and its contents, the Times reported that this group -- labelled &quot;Defense/Team Huddle&quot; -- was created by Hegseth himself, who accessed it with his private phone, not his government one.  
While his personal lawyer and brother have DOD jobs, neither seemingly had a &quot;need to know&quot; about the attacks. Hegseth appointed Parlatore as a Navy Reserve JAG Commander, with a focus on improving the training of JAG officers. Phil Hegseth is a DOD liaison with the Department of Homeland Security -- a post that hardly suggests a need to know about the imminent strike, much less a timeline detailing that F-18s, MQ-9 Reaper drones and Tomahawk cruise missiles would be used. 
In other words, this scenario seems to indicate a Secretary of Defense excitedly and unjustifiably sharing inside info with his wife and confidants. Validating his confirmation-opponents&apos; attacks on his lack of experience, the decision seems consistent with a SecDef whose own top military rank was Major in the National Guard. Meanwhile, the Signal chat about Yemen isn&apos;t the first time Jennifer Hegseth&apos;s involvement in her husband&apos;s job has raised eyebrows. Questions have also been raised over why Jennifer -- a former Fox News producer with no DOD job -- has participated in multiple meetings that covered sensitive topics, including one with the head of UK&apos;s military to discuss terminating the sharing of intelligence with Ukraine. 
John Ullyot -- who publicly advocated for Hegseth&apos;s confirmation -- now says Trump should dump him over Pentagon &quot;dysfunction&quot;


The second half of the weekend blitz against Hegseth came in the form of a Politico op-ed written by John Ullyot, a former champion of Hegseth who resigned from a Department of Defense public affairs role last month. He described the last month as &quot;total chaos at the Pentagon,&quot; saying that, given President Trump&apos;s &quot;strong record of holding his top officials to account...it’s hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer.&quot; 
In addition to the poor OPSEC of &quot;Signalgate&quot; and Hegseth&apos;s attempt to use a &quot;vague, Clinton-esque non-denial denial&quot; of the scandal, Hegseth focused on last week&apos;s firing of three top Pentagon staffers: senior adviser Dan Caldwell, deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick and chief of staff Colin Carroll. Ullyot wrote that Hegseth loyalists &quot;tried to smear the aides anonymously,&quot; dishonestly accusing them of leaking sensitive information. &quot;Hegseth’s team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door,&quot; wrote Ullyot. The &quot;strange and baffling purge&quot; is causing &quot;disarray,&quot; wrote Ullyot, who also called out the odd inclusion of Hegseth&apos;s wife in sensitive meetings. 
&quot;The president deserves better than the current mishegoss at the Pentagon,&quot; concluded Ullyot. &quot;Given his record of holding prior Cabinet leaders accountable, many in the secretary’s own inner circle will applaud quietly if Trump [fires Hegseth].&quot; 
No matter how much credence you attach to substance of these attacks on Hegseth, it&apos;s smart to consider the possible motives of those who are participating in them: the four people volunteering details about the newly-revealed Signal group chat, Hegseth cheerleader-turned-assailant John Ullyot, the New York Times, and especially Politico -- an outlet with a record of advancing the Deep State agenda. (Never forget the Oct 19 2020 Politico headline: &quot;Hunter Biden Story is Russian Disinfo, Dozens of Former Intel Officials Say.&quot;)   
On one front, Hegseth is going all-out on behalf of the national security apparatus, joining Trump in a campaign to throw perhaps every dollar of DOGE savings into a Pentagon rathole in a bid to push the DOD budget beyond $1 trillion:
Thank you Mr. President!

COMING SOON: the first TRILLION dollar @DeptofDefense budget.

President @realDonaldTrump is rebuilding our military — and FAST.

However, Hegseth may be an intolerable Deep State disappointment on a far more important front -- failing to deliver the US war on Iran that&apos;s been a decades-long ambition of the State of Israel and its American collaborators. Last week, the Times reported that Trump killed an Israeli proposal for a US-facilitated, week-long IDF bombing campaign on Iranian nuclear facilities in May, attributing the decision to key naysayers that included Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. Contemplating the specter of such an attack sparking an all-out war, Trump opted to give diplomacy a chance. 
That&apos;s the last thing many Deep State power brokers want.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The US might cut off military aid to Ukraine while suspending its strategic resource talks with Russia...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/18/europe/rubio-russia-war-in-ukraine-us-talks-intl-hnk/index.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that the US might stop mediating an end to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thealtworld.com/andrew_korybko/heres-what-i-learned-from-analyzing-the-new-cold-war-every-day-for-three-years-straight&quot;&gt;Ukrainian Conflict&lt;/a&gt; if it concludes within “a matter of days” that no peace deal is doable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That coincided with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/hdOfc&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; reporting that Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff told them that “Putin had been fixated on Ukrainian land in their discussions. He said that Russia might get some of the regions, but not all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis &lt;a href=&quot;https://korybko.substack.com/p/lavrov-elaborated-on-russias-envisaged&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; explained why it’s so important for Russia to obtain full control over the disputed lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If no breakthrough is achieved, such as the US coercing Ukraine into withdrawing from those regions or Russia agreeing to freeze this dimension of the conflict, then the US might indeed abandon its peace efforts. &lt;/strong&gt;The question therefore arises of how that could change its relations with Ukraine and Russia. Beginning with the first, Trump and his team’s explicitly expressed exhaustion with this conflict bodes ill for the scenario of the US continuing military support for Ukraine, which would please Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Europeans would try to replace some of this lost aid&lt;/strong&gt; in order to keep the conflict going in alignment with Zelensky’s vision, but they’d be unable to replace all of it and he might ultimately be forced into agreeing to worse terms than the US’ if Russia successfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://korybko.substack.com/p/will-russia-expand-its-ground-campaign&quot;&gt;expands its ground offensive&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, however, the US might also suspend its talks with Russia on the strategic resource deals that were supposed to serve as the centerpiece of their planned “&lt;a href=&quot;https://korybko.substack.com/p/russia-and-the-us-diplomatic-choreography&quot;&gt;New&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://korybko.substack.com/p/korybko-to-newsweek-a-russian-us&quot;&gt;Détente&lt;/a&gt;” as long as the conflict continues&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This balanced approach would be predicated on pressuring Ukraine and Russia into committing to compromises aimed at restoring the US-led peace talks since the first doesn’t want to lose territory in other regions while the second is interested in shaping the post-conflict era in partnership with the US. These evidently aren’t their top priorities, however, otherwise the land issue would have already been resolved one way or another and there wouldn’t be any talk of the US abandoning its peace efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other than the unlikely scenario of the US “escalating to de-escalate” on better terms for Ukraine, another comparatively more probable one exists but which is still less likely than the aforesaid, and that’s the US discontinuing military support for Ukraine but continuing resource talks with Russia.&lt;/strong&gt; These negotiations are connected to Ukraine since the US is seeking privileged terms from Russia in exchange for coercing Kiev into Moscow’s demanded concessions but can still proceed even if that doesn’t occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why this scenario is considered less likely than the balanced one described above is because some of the US’ sanctions that impede the clinching of resource deals with Russia can’t easily be lifted without first bringing about an end to the Ukrainian Conflict. Moreover, sanctions relief and the prospect of jointly shaping the post-conflict era are the only carrots that the US can dangle for incentivizing Russia to compromise on ending the conflict, which Trump wants it to do for solidifying his global legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s therefore expected to at least temporarily suspend such talks with Russia for that reason in that scenario but might resume them if the conflict remains protracted with no clear diplomatic or military solution. That would make the most sense since &lt;strong&gt;he wouldn’t prematurely give up the only means that the US has for incentivizing Russia to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thealtworld.com/andrew_korybko/will-putin-agree-to-a-ceasefire&quot;&gt;compromise for peace&lt;/a&gt; but he also wouldn’t lose the objective economic and strategic benefits that a resource deal would bring.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>How Might Washington&apos;s Relations With Ukraine &amp; Russia Change If It Abandons Its Peace Efforts?

            
Authored by Andrew Korybko via substack,
The US might cut off military aid to Ukraine while suspending its strategic resource talks with Russia...



Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday that the US might stop mediating an end to the Ukrainian Conflict if it concludes within “a matter of days” that no peace deal is doable.
That coincided with the Wall Street Journal reporting that Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff told them that “Putin had been fixated on Ukrainian land in their discussions. He said that Russia might get some of the regions, but not all.”

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/dxy%20dollar%20index%202.jpg?itok=mdtOyQBR&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/dxy%20dollar%20index%202.jpg?itok=mdtOyQBR&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;2b2d59b5-55c8-4586-ae76-8bfc0dfb549f&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;312&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/dxy%20dollar%20index%202.jpg?itok=mdtOyQBR&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no specific catalyst for the suddenly collapse in the illiquid early Asian session, which sees many countries on extended Easter holiday, Bloomberg quotes traders that hedge funds are selling the dollar against virtually any currencies after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that President Donald Trump is still exploring ways to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The president and his team will continue to study that,” National Economic Council Director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-18/trump-studying-whether-removing-powell-is-option-hassett-says&quot;&gt;Kevin Hassett said Friday&lt;/a&gt; when asked by a reporter if removing Powell was an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hassett then suggested, accurately, that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The policy of this Federal Reserve was to raise rates the minute President Trump was elected last time, to say that the supply-side tax cuts that were going to be inflationary,” Hassett said, adding that Fed officials opted not to go “on TV and at IMF meetings and warn about the terrible inflation from the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden, and the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden was textbook inflationary,” Hassett continued. “And then they cut rates right ahead of the election.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hassett, is of course, correct, as we first pointed out two weeks ago...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and, of course, gold which is storming to new record highs this evening, spiking above $3,373, its dip last week now a distant memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/gold%20usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=fWXgLfSJ&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/gold%20usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=fWXgLfSJ&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;085b99b0-98ad-4095-af14-4d3cfa11c1cd&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/gold%20usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=fWXgLfSJ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet none of these moves are surprising to anyone who read - as we repeatedly urged - the Miran Mar-A-Lago paper: yes, the plunge in the dollar is just what the admin quietly wants (they have repeatedly stated they want a strong dollar &quot;in the long term&quot;, but certainly not in the short, when the collapse in the greenback will boost US exports). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, if Powell will not cut rates to ease financial conditions, Trump&apos;s repeated browbeating of the Fed chair and threats to fire him will crash the dollar low enough to where Trump will get his financial easing one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there was one notable outlier in tonight&apos;s Dollar selloff: bitcoin. While previously any plunge in the dollar (and by extension surge in the yen) would batter what was little is left of the carry trade, hammering tech stocks and cryptos, tonight we finally saw a regime shift, and after flatlining initially, a burst of buying pushed bitcoin almost $2000 higher, above $87000, and its biggest one day move since Liberation Day...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/bitcoin%20snaps.jpg?itok=aSFVJ-X-&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/bitcoin%20snaps.jpg?itok=aSFVJ-X-&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;8a912e88-4dca-4189-a077-3f3e4c659fcc&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/bitcoin%20snaps.jpg?itok=aSFVJ-X-&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and the result is that while bitcoin had generally tracked the DXY Dollar index lower for much of 2025, the last few weeks - and certainly Sunday night - have seen a very tangible snap in this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/dollar%20vs%20bitcoin.jpg?itok=tHC7FNse&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/dollar%20vs%20bitcoin.jpg?itok=tHC7FNse&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;b4402399-1624-4822-b5da-8685d600ed39&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;302&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/dollar%20vs%20bitcoin.jpg?itok=tHC7FNse&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This breach in the right correlation between the two, suggests that with gold approaching ridiculous prices, the next flight to safety away from the collapsing dollar will be bitcoin - after all, &lt;strong&gt;it&apos;s only a matter of time before all other central banks unleash a money printing frenzy to hammer their own currencies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since all bitcoin needs is a little unexpected upside to spark a huge short squeeze and to get the momentum trades piling on, should today&apos;s phase reversal sustain for a few days, we may see new all time highs in bitcoin in a very short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait... because the real fun for non-fiat assets will start once other central banks - such as the BOJ and ECB - can no longer just sit and watch as the dollar disintegrates, pushing their own currencies into the stratosphere and killing their economies... and they retaliate by restarting the next round of global fiat debasement first by slashing rates and then by restarting the money printer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Dollar Crashes On Powell Removal Speculation, Gold Soars To All Time High And Bitcoin Suddenly Spikes

            
What was a miserable shortened week for the USD has gone from bad to worse in early Asia trading, when the Dollar index suddenly collapsed to a fresh 3 year low



While there is no specific catalyst for the suddenly collapse in the illiquid early Asian session, which sees many countries on extended Easter holiday, Bloomberg quotes traders that hedge funds are selling the dollar against virtually any currencies after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that President Donald Trump is still exploring ways to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to traders.
“The president and his team will continue to study that,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday when asked by a reporter if removing Powell was an option.
Hassett then suggested, accurately, that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats.
“The policy of this Federal Reserve was to raise rates the minute President Trump was elected last time, to say that the supply-side tax cuts that were going to be inflationary,” Hassett said, adding that Fed officials opted not to go “on TV and at IMF meetings and warn about the terrible inflation from the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden, and the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden was textbook inflationary,” Hassett continued. “And then they cut rates right ahead of the election.”
Hassett, is of course, correct, as we first pointed out two weeks ago...

... as Bank of America&apos;s Michael Hartnett pointed out on Friday...
Fed cut 50bps in Sept when stock market at record high, Atlanta Fed was forecasting +3% US GDP growth; Fed now determined not to cut rates after 20% market plunge, Atlanta Fed forecasting -3% GDP growth
... and as former NY Fed president Bill Dudley made crystal clear all the way back in 2019.
The day is August 27, 2019. Former NY Fed president Bill Dudley writes a Bloomberg oped saying &quot;the Fed shouldn&apos;t enable Donald Trump&quot; and urged the central bank not to &quot;provide offsetting stimulus&quot; in Trump&apos;s trade war with China.

But since the market is terrified of the truth, especially if it means that Trump could take monetary policy actions into his own hands, the result has been a wholesale liquidation of all main currency pairs, with the EUR jumping to 3 year highs, even though Europe&apos;s economy remains an unmitigated disaster (Germany&apos;s upcoming debt spending spree notwithstanding), and even though the surge in the euro will make Europe&apos;s modest recession into a brutal one..



... the Yen surging 11% from its January lows, and at just over 141, the highest it has been against the dollar since the summer of 2023...



... and, of course, gold which is storming to new record highs this evening, spiking above $3,373, its dip last week now a distant memory.



Yet none of these moves are surprising to anyone who read - as we repeatedly urged - the Miran Mar-A-Lago paper: yes, the plunge in the dollar is just what the admin quietly wants (they have repeatedly stated they want a strong dollar &quot;in the long term&quot;, but certainly not in the short, when the collapse in the greenback will boost US exports).
