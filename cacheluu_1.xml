      <title>🚨 TRUMP MAY CUT CHINA TARIFFS TO EASE TENSIONS

The Trump administration is weighing major tariff cuts on Chinese imports—possibly by over 50%—to reduce trade tensions, sources say. No final decision has been made, and options remain open.

One idea is a tiered system:

🔸 35% tariffs on non-strategic items

🔸 100%+ tariffs on goods tied to national security

🔸 Phased in over five years

Trump confirmed Tuesday that his 145% tariffs could be reduced but “won’t be zero.” Markets reacted positively to the news.

China responded by signaling openness to talks but warned it won’t negotiate under U.S. threats. Some in Beijing see Trump’s shift as backing down. (From Walter Bloomberg)</title>

      <title>Keep watching the U.S. Dollar:

As the S&amp;P 500 rises +5% in 2 days on “tariff de-escalation” headlines, the U.S. Dollar Index, $DXY, is up a mere 0.2% today.

The U.S. Dollar is just about the only asset not buying these headlines today.

Furthermore, the U.S. Dollar has been a key leading indicator of trade war sentiment.

It’s almost as though the U.S. Dollar thinks U.S. trade headlines have lost credibility.

Something is off. (From TKL)</title>

      <title>Retail investors were just cheated:

Yesterday at 12:00 PM ET, US Treasury Secretary Bessent said he sees &quot;de-escalation with China&quot; and the current situation is &quot;unsustainable.&quot;

These comments were provided at a CLOSED-DOOR investor summit hosted by JP Morgan.

This summit was not open to the public or to the media.

Then, at 5:18 PM ET, President Trump said tariffs on China &quot;will not be as high as 145%.&quot;

Bessent effectively told a closed-group of Wall Street investors that de-escalation with China was coming BEFORE the public knew.

The result was a move of +5% in S&amp;P 500 futures, for a total of +$2.2 TRILLION of market cap.

Investors at the JP Morgan event were able to front-run these headlines.

      <title>R to @KobeissiLetter: This coincided with a sudden shift in Trump&apos;s tone on China.

Trump is now claiming that tariffs on China will come down from 145%.

It seems like tariffs are set to come down and Powell is staying (for now).

      <title>Something doesn&apos;t add up here:

1. Trump on April 7th: Fed Chair Powell is &quot;slow moving&quot;

2. Bessent on April 14th: Trump Admin is thinking of successor to Powell

3. Trump on April 17th: Fed Chair Powell &quot;will be out of there&quot;

4. Trump on April 19th: &quot;Studying&quot; if he can fire Fed Chair Powell

5. Trump on April 21st: Fed Chair Powell is &quot;a major loser&quot;

6. Trump today: &quot;No intention&quot; to fire Fed Chair Powell

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 5) But I think the fundamentals of Austin are solid. The area&apos;s population growth is top of the table.

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 3) Prior to pandemic, in 2019, prices in Austin traded for 4.0x income.

The typical value was $313k and the median income was $78k. 

In order to understand home prices, you have to understand it&apos;s all relative. Income is the main input that matters, along with rent. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 2) To understand this point clearer: the typical home value in Austin is $449k right now. Which is 4.4x the area&apos;s median income.

This 4.4x Home Value/Income Ratio is now almost back down to the long-term, 20 -year average.

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 1) The way Austin has become more fairly valued is through two mechanisms.

First - prices have dropped 20.4% from their peak in 2022. Returning affordability.

Second - the median income in the metro has continued rising, and is now up to $102,000, increasing relative affordability. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>
