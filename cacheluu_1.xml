      <title>Global trade outlook is deteriorating:

The World Trade Organization expects world merchandise trade to fall -0.2% in 2025, down from +2.7% growth expected at the beginning of the year.

This would follow the +2.9% growth recorded in 2024.

North American trade is set to be hit the hardest, while Asia and Europe will continue to see modest growth.

The WTO also highlights that if the US imposes higher reciprocal tariffs after a 90-day pause, global merchandise trade could drop by -1.5% this year.

For 2026, the WTO forecasts +2.5% growth, down from the previously expected +2.9%.

Global trade is experiencing a historic slowdown. (From TKL)</title>

      <contentSnippet>Global trade outlook is deteriorating:

The World Trade Organization expects world merchandise trade to fall -0.2% in 2025, down from +2.7% growth expected at the beginning of the year.

This would follow the +2.9% growth recorded in 2024.

North American trade is set to be hit the hardest, while Asia and Europe will continue to see modest growth.

The WTO also highlights that if the US imposes higher reciprocal tariffs after a 90-day pause, global merchandise trade could drop by -1.5% this year.

For 2026, the WTO forecasts +2.5% growth, down from the previously expected +2.9%.

Global trade is experiencing a historic slowdown.</contentSnippet>

      <title>OPTIONS TRADERS POSITIONED FOR MORE WILD STOCK SWINGS

     Investors are bracing for more stock market volatility ahead.
     Options traders are betting on a move of 1% or more, higher or lower, in the S&amp;P 500 for every session through at least May 23, according to a Monday note from Citigroup strategists.
     Those moves are expected to be higher on days of economic importance: Options are pricing in a swing of 1.8% in the benchmark index when the April jobs report is released, and a move of 1.7% the day of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell&apos;s post-meeting press conference in May.

      <title>GOLDMAN SACHS LOWERS 1Q GDP ESTIMATE 

Goldman Sachs economists now think that the economy grew at a 0.1% annualized pace in the three months through March, down from 0.4% previously. New home sales grew by more than expected last month, but the construction deflator declined by less than Goldman expected, denting the read-through to inflation-adjusted growth. The first official estimate of 1Q GDP from the Commerce Department lands April 30. (From Walter Bloomberg)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 6) To be clear: all these housing markets still have some issues. Particularly, outbound migration. They all lost people during pandemic, and still might be losing some people today.

But in terms of fundamentals (home prices to income, and to rent) they are well-priced. And historically affordable.

Indicating we could be seeing a renaissance for the legacy big city housing markets the next 5 years. Especially if return to office mandates keep happening. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 5) I think this next one is my favorite, though. Cook County in Chicago.

In the last bubble, prices were trading at 5.2x incomes in Chicago.

Then there was a correction. And since then, values have kept pace with incomes, and today&apos;s 3.7x multiple is one of the cheapest in the country for a major city. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

Bronx - 22%
DC - 18%
New Orelans - 11%
San Francisco- 11%
Queens - 5%
Brooklyn - 4%
Chicago - 3%
Boston - 2%

All legacy, big city housing markets for most part. They struggled during pandemic and lost people. But now they could be in for a turn-around.

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 6) No one else in the housing market is really talking about Manhattan.

Suggesting a turnaround could be in the offering. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>
