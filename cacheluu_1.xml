      <title>$TSLA - MUSK&apos;S DOGE DEPARTURE SEEN AS END OF DARK CHAPTER FOR TESLA: WEDBUSH

Elon Musk said on Tesla&apos;s latest earnings call that his role in the Trump administration is winding down and that he will be returning his attention to Tesla, a move that allows Musk to turn the corner from a &quot;dark chapter&quot; that accompanied a disastrous quarter for the EV maker, Wedbush analysts Dan Ives and Sam Brandeis say in a research note. They view the call as a turning point in the Tesla story. This was an off-ramp for Tesla to escape the global brand damage, political firestorm and chaos of the past few months, the analysts say. They expect Musk will spend minimal, if any, time with DOGE from here out (From Walter Bloomberg)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 6) To be clear: all these housing markets still have some issues. Particularly, outbound migration. They all lost people during pandemic, and still might be losing some people today.

But in terms of fundamentals (home prices to income, and to rent) they are well-priced. And historically affordable.

Indicating we could be seeing a renaissance for the legacy big city housing markets the next 5 years. Especially if return to office mandates keep happening. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>R to @nickgerli1: 5) I think this next one is my favorite, though. Cook County in Chicago.

In the last bubble, prices were trading at 5.2x incomes in Chicago.

Then there was a correction. And since then, values have kept pace with incomes, and today&apos;s 3.7x multiple is one of the cheapest in the country for a major city. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

Yet today, they&apos;re trading for 10.8x median income.

      <title>Here are the counties in America that are &quot;undervalued&quot; in terms of home prices to income.

Manhattan - 25% undervalued
Bronx - 22%
DC - 18%
New Orelans - 11%
San Francisco- 11%
Queens - 5%
Brooklyn - 4%
Chicago - 3%
Boston - 2%

All legacy, big city housing markets for most part. They struggled during pandemic and lost people. But now they could be in for a turn-around.

Real estate is the cheapest it&apos;s been in these areas in decades. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</title>

      <title>Keep watching the U.S. Dollar:

As the S&amp;P 500 rises +5% in 2 days on “tariff de-escalation” headlines, the U.S. Dollar Index, $DXY, is up a mere 0.2% today.

The U.S. Dollar is just about the only asset not buying these headlines today.

Furthermore, the U.S. Dollar has been a key leading indicator of trade war sentiment.

It’s almost as though the U.S. Dollar thinks U.S. trade headlines have lost credibility.

Something is off. (From TKL)</title>

      <title>Retail investors were just cheated:

Yesterday at 12:00 PM ET, US Treasury Secretary Bessent said he sees &quot;de-escalation with China&quot; and the current situation is &quot;unsustainable.&quot;

These comments were provided at a CLOSED-DOOR investor summit hosted by JP Morgan.

This summit was not open to the public or to the media.

Then, at 5:18 PM ET, President Trump said tariffs on China &quot;will not be as high as 145%.&quot;

Bessent effectively told a closed-group of Wall Street investors that de-escalation with China was coming BEFORE the public knew.

The result was a move of +5% in S&amp;P 500 futures, for a total of +$2.2 TRILLION of market cap.

Investors at the JP Morgan event were able to front-run these headlines.

      <title>R to @KobeissiLetter: This coincided with a sudden shift in Trump&apos;s tone on China.

Trump is now claiming that tariffs on China will come down from 145%.

It seems like tariffs are set to come down and Powell is staying (for now).
