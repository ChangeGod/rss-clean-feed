            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Wind-Power/The-UK-Is-Doubling-Down-on-Wind-Energy.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Felicity Bradstock via OilPrice.com,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UK is expanding its wind energy capacity, particularly offshore, with the approval of the Rampion 2 project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rampion 2 expansion will add 1.2 GW of capacity, enough to power around 1 million UK homes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UK government aims to quadruple its offshore wind capacity by 2030 as part of its net-zero carbon goals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K. is already a world leader in wind energy, having rapidly expanded both its onshore and offshore wind capacity over the last decade. Now, under the new Labour government, the U.K. hopes to expand its wind power sector even further through the massive expansion of the Rampion offshore wind farm. &lt;strong&gt;This is expected to help the government progress towards achieving its net-zero carbon ambitions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-18_dzaab0nuh1.jpg?itok=aQ4IUsWw&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-18_dzaab0nuh1.jpg?itok=aQ4IUsWw&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;8b5598e6-5987-43c9-9f07-c318fdf05420&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;209&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-18_dzaab0nuh1.jpg?itok=aQ4IUsWw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 2023, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.renewableuk.com/media/xyubzj4o/wind-energy-facts-and-figures-brochure-september-2024-final.pdf&quot;&gt;46.4 percent of the UK’s electricity was generated using renewable energy sources&lt;/a&gt;, of which wind energy contributed 61 percent. &lt;/strong&gt;Around 39.7 percent of the U.K.’s wind energy is generated onshore and the remaining 60.3 offshore. The U.K. constructed its first commercial onshore wind farm in 1991, generating 1 GW of wind capacity. In 2024, the U.K.’s wind energy capacity increased to 30GW, double that of 2017. The U.K. has 11,906 turbines, with 9,141 onshore and 2,765 offshore, consisting of 10 floating and 2,755 fixed turbines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approximately 32,000 people are employed in the U.K.’s offshore wind industry, a figure that is expected to increase to over 120,000 by 2030.&lt;/strong&gt; The government also hopes to achieve 60 GW of wind capacity by the end of the decade, which could add as much as $58.5 billion to the economy. By the beginning of 2025, the U.K. had grown its offshore wind energy capacity to become the largest in Europe and &lt;a href=&quot;https://maritime-executive.com/article/wind-energy-becomes-uk-s-largest-source-of-electricity-surpassing-gas#:~:text=The%20UK%27s%20offshore%20wind%20sector,growth%20in%20the%20following%20years.&quot;&gt;second only to China&lt;/a&gt;, at 14 GW. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In early April, the government approved plans to develop Rampion 2, an offshore wind farm with enough energy to power around 1 million U.K. homes. &lt;/strong&gt;The expansion of the Rampion offshore wind farm, off England’s south coast, would include the addition of 90 turbines to add 1.2 GW of capacity. The project is expected to create 4,000 jobs during the construction phase, which is scheduled to commence in 2026. The government decision on the expansion was expected to be delivered in February but it has been delayed while more information is collected from the project’s developer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind farm is being developed by RWE as the majority shareholder (50.1 percent), a Macquarie-led consortium (25 percent), and Enbridge (24.9 percent). The electricity produced at Rampion will be transported to land via subsea cables. An underground cable will then deliver the power inland to a new substation at Oakendene near Cowfold before connecting it to the national grid at Bolney in Sussex. &lt;strong&gt;The wind farm is expected to be operational by the late 2020s. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danielle Lane, the director of offshore wind development U.K. and Ireland at RWE, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.power-technology.com/news/uk-rampion-wind-farm-extension/?cf-view&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt;, “We are delighted to receive the development consent order for the proposed Rampion 2 offshore wind farm. This is a key milestone in the development of the project, as Rampion 2 can play an important role in helping secure the U.K.’s energy supplies from our abundant wind resource and play a key role in supporting the U.K. government’s clean power ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since coming into power last July, the Labour government has gone full throttle on the deployment of green energy, with plans to double the U.K.’s onshore wind, triple its solar power, and quadruple its offshore wind power capacity by 2030. It has also announced plans to reduce the contribution of natural gas to the country’s electricity generation to just 5 percent by the end of the decade. Thanks to the development of a more friendly investment environment, in an event in October some of the world’s largest green energy companies pledged to invest almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Labours-Leadership-Has-Sparked-Massive-Clean-Energy-Investments-in-the-UK.html&quot;&gt;$31.39 billion across the U.K&lt;/a&gt;., demonstrating that greater public investment in the sector is attracting higher levels of private financing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/04/offshore-windfarm-in-sussex-turbines-rampion&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The U.K. has a boundless supply of wind that cannot be turned on and off at the whims of dictators and petrostates. It’s time to get off the fossil fuel rollercoaster, roll out clean power, protect our energy security and bring down bills for good.” He added, “This project puts us within reach of our clean power offshore wind target,” Miliband said. “Through our plan for change, we’re getting on with delivering the clean energy and jobs Britain needs.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year was a record year for wind energy production, with onshore and offshore projects producing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e3g9xv3ylo&quot;&gt;83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, an increase from almost 79 TWh in 2023. In around 10 days in December alone, over 50 percent of Britain&apos;s electricity production came from wind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, there are also less windy periods, where energy production is lower. This suggests the need for greater investment in battery storage technology to make the renewable energy source more reliable and help reduce the U.K.’s reliance on fossil fuels during low-production times.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. is already a major onshore and offshore producer of wind energy, having developed several projects over the last three decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approval of the new Rampion 2 project is expected to put the country on track to achieve its end-of-decade climate goals, by decarbonising its transmission network. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is one of many clean energy projects the Labour government has announced over the last eight months, with the ambitious green transition agenda expected to attract high levels of private funding in the sector.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>The UK Is Doubling Down On Wind Energy

The UK is expanding its wind energy capacity, particularly offshore, with the approval of the Rampion 2 project.
The Rampion 2 expansion will add 1.2 GW of capacity, enough to power around 1 million UK homes.
The UK government aims to quadruple its offshore wind capacity by 2030 as part of its net-zero carbon goals.

      <title>China Is In Economic Dire Straits And They&apos;re No Longer Able To Hide It</title>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;China Is In Economic Dire Straits And They&apos;re No Longer Able To Hide It&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official economic data from any government is always treated with suspicion by anyone with common sense.  The US, for example, witnessed some of the most egregious statistical tinkering imaginable under the Biden Administration, not to mention outright lies and propaganda from the establishment media on the health of the economy.  To this day no one has been fired (or tarred and feathered) for hiding the reality of the stagflation crisis.  Any government or corporate economist that called the threat &quot;transitory&quot; should be stripped of their financial prestige and banished to a cash register at Arby&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let&apos;s not forget Biden&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/lost-todays-job-revision-chaos-over-1-million-foreign-born-workers-found-job-and-no&quot;&gt;misrepresentation of the labor market&lt;/a&gt;, portraying millions of new jobs for illegal migrants and visa holders as if they were jobs benefiting American citizens.  In the US and across the western world, lying about the economy is generally seen by politicians as a temporary solution to secure reelection.  However, in China, lying about the economy is treated as a national security imperative.  If there&apos;s anything in the world that gives communists a feeling of existential dread, it&apos;s the fear that their ideological enemies will discover proof that communism doesn&apos;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump Administration&apos;s tariffs on China are not the initiator of the nation&apos;s troubles, they are more a bookend to a process of decline that has been ongoing for years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/ChinaCollapse1.jpg?itok=lS6l1vUv&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ChinaCollapse1.jpg?itok=lS6l1vUv&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;e772fc85-54bc-46af-8e54-e69f5d50b72d&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ChinaCollapse1.jpg?itok=lS6l1vUv&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall tariffs on Chinese goods currently sit at 124%, but some goods will be taxed as high as 245%.  Trump has given a 1 month exemption on electronic parts and devices, perhaps to offer manufacturers like Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft time to arrange sourcing from alternative vendors.  The problem for Chinese manufacturers is not just the tariffs but the uncertainty of timing and sudden changes to policy.  They say no one is willing to make a big move on production or shipments until the trade landscape becomes more predictable.  This means most Chinese factories are frozen in stasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s tariff actions are widely criticized by the media as erratic or poorly planned, but what they don&apos;t understand is that uncertainty is the real leverage, not the tariffs.  What seems like a spur of the moment decision or a sudden capitulation on Trump&apos;s part can be highly effective at throwing foreign governments and corporations off balance.  Globalism requires a perpetual status quo, change of any kind is like holy water to a vampire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese shipments are on standby and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/16/trade-war-fallout-china-freight-ship-decline-begins-orders-plummet.html&quot;&gt;orders are frozen&lt;/a&gt;.  Nothing is moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQ9klecFbMw&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At bottom, China will not be able to survive tariffs on the current scale for long (a single year of 124% tariffs would crush China&apos;s economy beyond repair).  The US is 15% of China&apos;s export market, which may not sound substantial but their next largest trading partner (outside of Hong Kong) is Vietnam at 4% of exports.  In terms of domestic buying, China is 11% of the global consumer market which is not too shabby, but compared to the US with its 30%-35% global consumer market share there is no chance that the Chinese will be able to fill the void domestically and stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the situation is far worse than most people know...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been suffering from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-deflation-housing-congress-36d116f4657aa3064882af9b2dd57b14&quot;&gt;deflationary crisis since 2023&lt;/a&gt;.  An uptick in exports during the pandemic was offset by the CCP&apos;s draconian lockdowns.  This was, essentially, fiscal suicide on the part of the government and China has been struggling ever since.  Their property market has imploded, partially due to overbuilding through government subsidized infrastructure programs that flooded the market with poorly constructed homes and buildings that were then left to rot.  Corporate defaults have run rampant and left investors with nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some optimism that the government’s measures to end the crisis had been working to reinvigorate the market, but on Mar 31st, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/why-china-cant-sort-out-its-property-market-mess&quot;&gt;government-linked developer Vanke&lt;/a&gt; reported a record 49.5 billion yuan (S$9.1 billion) annual loss for 2024.  It’s the company’s first full-year loss since its initial public offering in 1991, reigniting concerns about the sector and showing just how deep the problem runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gVtO4FIb3vw&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these projects do finally see some progress it is often due to dangerously poor construction standards and subpar workmanship; what many now refer to as &quot;Tofu Dreg&quot; buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWOBYGC9JJI?start=26&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deflationary spiral has been eating away at employment and has also resulted in numerous factories refusing to pay their workers on time (or at all).  Unpaid wages are leading to frequent protests and a disturbing trend of factory fires.  The government is limited in how it can respond to the problem.  Stimulus is an option, but China&apos;s &lt;span data-huuid=&quot;16814439806895594041&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;overall non-financial debt is well over 300% of GDP already.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&apos;s attempts to hide the decay from the outside world are becoming less and less effective.  With Chinese citizens able to access the internet beyond the &quot;Great Firewall&quot;, more and more videos are being leaked by people within the country who are tired of the misinformation.  Again, the CCP views negative economic data as a national security threat and any citizen caught leaking this info could be subject to harsh punishment.  Chinese citizens have taken substantial risks to get the truth out there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It cannot be stressed enough that the global economy is largely a farce, but China is closest to the edge of the cliff in terms of consequences and crisis.  The interdependency of globalism has left many nations without the ability to weather a trade dispute and China&apos;s survival is almost entirely based on steady exports to the west and the US in particular. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t let high paid TikTok and YouTube influencers fool you with videos of Chinese skyscrapers caked with LED lights or lavish parties with dancing robots.  This is not the true China.  Underneath the facade is a nation on the brink of disaster.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Trump&apos;s tariff actions are widely criticized by the media as erratic or poorly planned, but what they don&apos;t understand is that uncertainty is the real leverage, not the tariffs.  What seems like a spur of the moment decision or a sudden capitulation on Trump&apos;s part can be highly effective at throwing foreign governments and corporations off balance.  Globalism requires a perpetual status quo, change of any kind is like holy water to a vampire.
Chinese shipments are on standby and orders are frozen.  Nothing is moving.

At bottom, China will not be able to survive tariffs on the current scale for long (a single year of 124% tariffs would crush China&apos;s economy beyond repair).  The US is 15% of China&apos;s export market, which may not sound substantial but their next largest trading partner (outside of Hong Kong) is Vietnam at 4% of exports.  In terms of domestic buying, China is 11% of the global consumer market which is not too shabby, but compared to the US with its 30%-35% global consumer market share there is no chance that the Chinese will be able to fill the void domestically and stay afloat.
But the situation is far worse than most people know...
China has been suffering from a deflationary crisis since 2023.  An uptick in exports during the pandemic was offset by the CCP&apos;s draconian lockdowns.  This was, essentially, fiscal suicide on the part of the government and China has been struggling ever since.  Their property market has imploded, partially due to overbuilding through government subsidized infrastructure programs that flooded the market with poorly constructed homes and buildings that were then left to rot.  Corporate defaults have run rampant and left investors with nothing.
There was some optimism that the government’s measures to end the crisis had been working to reinvigorate the market, but on Mar 31st, government-linked developer Vanke reported a record 49.5 billion yuan (S$9.1 billion) annual loss for 2024.  It’s the company’s first full-year loss since its initial public offering in 1991, reigniting concerns about the sector and showing just how deep the problem runs.

When these projects do finally see some progress it is often due to dangerously poor construction standards and subpar workmanship; what many now refer to as &quot;Tofu Dreg&quot; buildings.

The deflationary spiral has been eating away at employment and has also resulted in numerous factories refusing to pay their workers on time (or at all).  Unpaid wages are leading to frequent protests and a disturbing trend of factory fires.  The government is limited in how it can respond to the problem.  Stimulus is an option, but China&apos;s overall non-financial debt is well over 300% of GDP already.  
China&apos;s attempts to hide the decay from the outside world are becoming less and less effective.  With Chinese citizens able to access the internet beyond the &quot;Great Firewall&quot;, more and more videos are being leaked by people within the country who are tired of the misinformation.  Again, the CCP views negative economic data as a national security threat and any citizen caught leaking this info could be subject to harsh punishment.  Chinese citizens have taken substantial risks to get the truth out there.  
It cannot be stressed enough that the global economy is largely a farce, but China is closest to the edge of the cliff in terms of consequences and crisis.  The interdependency of globalism has left many nations without the ability to weather a trade dispute and China&apos;s survival is almost entirely based on steady exports to the west and the US in particular. 
Don&apos;t let high paid TikTok and YouTube influencers fool you with videos of Chinese skyscrapers caked with LED lights or lavish parties with dancing robots.  This is not the true China.  Underneath the facade is a nation on the brink of disaster.

&lt;p&gt;Mcebisi Jonas doesn’t usually suffer from nerves. If he did, he wouldn’t have survived a brutal guerrilla campaign against South Africa’s apartheid foot-soldiers in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As a cadre for the ANC [then-banned African National Congress], I was fighting for freedom from racism, for black people’s right to vote, for human rights,” &lt;/strong&gt;he told The Epoch Times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Now, I am about to fight another, very different battle. I am a bit nervous, but I am ready to talk with any and all representatives of the U.S. president, and I trust we will treat one another with respect,”&lt;/strong&gt; said Pretoria’s eloquent former minister of finance and now successful businessman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonas is part of a recently created exclusive club of special envoys appointed by most of Africa’s 54 countries to negotiate better export terms they hope will allow them to sell their goods for “reasonable profit” in the world’s most lucrative market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2890%29_5.jpg?itok=c5nEg-Mk&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2890%29_5.jpg?itok=c5nEg-Mk&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;0ff1bf45-cd19-42a8-9584-06382eac8d2f&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2890%29_5.jpg?itok=c5nEg-Mk&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s April 2 announcement of tariffs on goods exported to the United States by its economic partners. Trump has said the duties would correct trade imbalances he said are unfair to America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week later, Trump paused his reciprocal tariffs for 90 days—except for those on China—indicating that many countries had reached out and that the United States was open to negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If nothing were to change after the 90-day pause, some of the highest tariffs—between 30 and 50 percent—would be for products imported from Africa.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa’s envoys are now rushing to meet the deadline in July when the raised duties are scheduled to come into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2891%29_5.jpg?itok=9WTmjdvf&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2891%29_5.jpg?itok=9WTmjdvf&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;89c44cc2-10d3-46c9-9de4-78e330aec285&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2891%29_5.jpg?itok=9WTmjdvf&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Most African countries export much more to the United States than they import from the United States, so the Trump administration calculated that trade between the regions is unfairly weighted towards Africa and that the United States is losing out,”&lt;/em&gt; explained Morné Malan, deputy head of policy at South Africa’s Free Market Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Besides trade deficits, Trump also looked for other signs of trade barriers as criteria for imposing tariffs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya, with which the United States enjoyed a trade surplus, is an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the United States Trade Representative, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/africa/east-africa/kenya&quot;&gt;East Africa’s largest economy&lt;/a&gt; exported goods—mainly textiles, coffee, tea, and fruit—to the value of $737.3 million to the United States in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That year, Kenya imported goods worth $782.5 million from the United States, primarily petroleum products, aircraft and related parts, machinery, and pharmaceuticals, giving the United States a trade surplus of $45.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, President William Ruto’s government had anticipated that Trump would hit Kenya with a higher tariff, as Nairobi charges a 10 percent tax on American imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, said Trade and Industry cabinet secretary, Lee Kinyanjui, the country went into “damage control mode,” dispatching a team of negotiators to the White House a day before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Kenyan government’s main objective of securing duty-free or “very favourable duty access” for its goods into the U.S. market is still the subject of talks, Trump levied a reciprocal tariff of only 10 percent on Nairobi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We believe it helped us a lot to speak to Trump’s people ahead of his announcement, and directly afterwards,” Kinyanjui told The Epoch Times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We are considering a free trade agreement with the United States, and that will mean the scrapping of the tariff on American goods entering Kenya, and we will hopefully still export duty-free to the United States. That is reciprocity.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Gruzd of the South African Institute of International Affairs described Kenya as a “bit of an anomaly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am no fan of the African governments that steal their countries’ resources and keep their people poor, but I must also agree that it’s a bit of a stretch to expect nations with low GDPs and tiny budgets and huge debts and low manufacturing bases to import at large scale expensive goods, products and services from the wealthiest economy in the world,” he told The Epoch Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in this context that the African envoys will visit the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“He’s about to enter a lion’s den,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Malan said of Jonas, the South African diplomat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2892%29_5.jpg?itok=7eDf9QrL&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2892%29_5.jpg?itok=7eDf9QrL&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;34af53c3-4f69-40d3-a2b8-cfa5f6847aa3&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2892%29_5.jpg?itok=7eDf9QrL&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ 31 percent tariffs on South Africa—which was included in a list of 60 nations Trump said had traded with his country unfairly during his announcement on April 2—is just the president’s latest salvo against the continent’s largest, most industrialized economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country featured prominently in the series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025&quot;&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt; Trump has signed since re-entering the White House on Jan. 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of his first executive orders, the U.S. leader accused Pretoria of implementing racist laws aimed at discriminating and encouraging violence against white Afrikaners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump subsequently withdrew $440 million in annual funding to South Africa, resulting in a slowdown of the country’s HIV treatment and prevention program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He said South Africa is a threat to U.S. national security as its ANC government has military and economic alliances with some of Washington’s primary geopolitical foes, including China, Iran, and Russia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump also criticized Pretoria for launching a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/South-Africa-v-Israel.pdf&quot;&gt;case of genocide&lt;/a&gt; in the Gaza war against Israel at the International Court of Justice. The war was triggered by terrorist group Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, Secretary of State Marco Rubio expelled South Africa’s ambassador to Washington, the ANC’s Ebrahim Rasool, after the diplomat described Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement and his administration as “supremacist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonas grimaced and said, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Yes, recent history between South Africa and the United States is not good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But I am convinced we can cooperate going forward and we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement that will foster the flow of American goods into our country, and vice versa.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Gruzd of the South African Institute of International Affairs said that, in communications within the Trump administration, “it has become clear that they consider Pretoria to be the enemy, giving the [President Cyril] Ramaphosa government the same status as Beijing and Moscow and Tehran.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many in Africa, said Gruzd, Pretoria has “good cards to deal” to convince the U.S. president. Its cards are beaming the allure of the continent’s vast resources, which include precious metals like gold and platinum, and critical minerals essential to energy security and defense, as they’re major components of weapons and military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a paper analyzing Africa’s potential responses to the U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-should-africa-respond-trumps-new-tariffs&quot;&gt;tariffs&lt;/a&gt;, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington said 24 of Africa’s 54 countries are dependent on mining and minerals for income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Africa holds a third of the world’s critical minerals&lt;/strong&gt;, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/what-african-producers-of-critical-minerals-can-learn-from-indonesias-experience/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by U.S. think-tank The Atlantic Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa already supplies almost all of America’s chromium and provides a quarter of its manganese requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/manganese-statistics-and-information&quot;&gt;Manganese&lt;/a&gt; is a diverse mineral, used to produce steel and rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chromium features prominently in weapons manufacturing, including missile systems and fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other minerals produced at a large scale by African countries include lithium, used in electric car batteries, and coltan, used in communications equipment like cell phones and computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Trump has exempted critical minerals from tariffs, Gruzd said South Africa’s mineral wealth still has a role in possibly lowering the U.S. levies on South Africa, considering the Trump administration’s wish to reduce U.S. dependency on Chinese supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“China dominates Africa’s minerals sector, and it has mines all over the place, from DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo] to Zambia to Guinea,”&lt;/strong&gt; Gruzd said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beijing’s harvesting of the continent’s minerals and metals and processing them has placed the United States at an immense disadvantage in terms of making sure it has a reliable supply of these critical items well into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gruzd said if the United States and South Africa can strike a deal on critical minerals, “that would be a big win, politically and economically, for the Trump administration.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If Trump is offered mining rights in certain African countries, this would go a long way in persuading him to lower tariffs and perhaps even drop them because it would give the United States a big foothold in global supply chains,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS said that Trump should revoke tariffs on African countries and that the African Union and African leaders “should seek to demonstrate that preferential trade with the continent, in fact, overall serves U.S. national interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just like Canada and Mexico were exempt from the reciprocal tariffs due to the United States’ national interest, a similar case can be made for Africa in terms of market access and critical minerals supply chain security,” wrote economic development experts Hannah Ryder, Trevor Lwere, and Ovigwe Eguegu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As tariffs are set to hit U.S. firms in the automotive, aerospace, and chemical sectors, which are heavily dependent on critical minerals, the bulk of which Africa has, it is not in the U.S. interest to impose tariffs on African goods.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryder, Lwere, and Eguegu highlighted that one of the Trump administration’s aims is to gain greater market access for American firms and products abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This requires the existence of purchasing power amongst foreign consumers. By imposing tariffs on African exports to the United States, however, the United States makes it difficult for Africa to obtain the purchasing power necessary to demand U.S. products,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The experts said the United States should support preferential access for African goods to the American market as a market-building strategy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is critical, they wrote, especially considering that Africa has the youngest population and will be home to over 25 percent of the global population in the next few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bamidele Ayemibo, lead trade policy consultant at Nigeria’s 3T Impex Consulting Limited, said African governments’ response to Trump’s tariffs should be to sign preferential trade agreements with the United States—and with other partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The last thing they should do is retaliate with higher tariffs on U.S. products; they do not have the economic power to do so and they will only hurt themselves,” he told The Epoch Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Now, more than ever, it is time for talk and for bargaining.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Minerals In Hand, Africa&apos;s Trade Envoys Head For The US

Its cards are beaming the allure of the continent’s vast resources, which include precious metals like gold and platinum, and critical minerals essential to energy security and defense, as they’re major components of weapons and military equipment.
In a paper analyzing Africa’s potential responses to the U.S. tariffs, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington said 24 of Africa’s 54 countries are dependent on mining and minerals for income.
Africa holds a third of the world’s critical minerals, according to a study by U.S. think-tank The Atlantic Council.
South Africa already supplies almost all of America’s chromium and provides a quarter of its manganese requirements.
Manganese is a diverse mineral, used to produce steel and rechargeable batteries.
Chromium features prominently in weapons manufacturing, including missile systems and fighter jets.
Other minerals produced at a large scale by African countries include lithium, used in electric car batteries, and coltan, used in communications equipment like cell phones and computers.
Although Trump has exempted critical minerals from tariffs, Gruzd said South Africa’s mineral wealth still has a role in possibly lowering the U.S. levies on South Africa, considering the Trump administration’s wish to reduce U.S. dependency on Chinese supplies.
“China dominates Africa’s minerals sector, and it has mines all over the place, from DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo] to Zambia to Guinea,” Gruzd said.
“Beijing’s harvesting of the continent’s minerals and metals and processing them has placed the United States at an immense disadvantage in terms of making sure it has a reliable supply of these critical items well into the future.
Gruzd said if the United States and South Africa can strike a deal on critical minerals, “that would be a big win, politically and economically, for the Trump administration.”
“If Trump is offered mining rights in certain African countries, this would go a long way in persuading him to lower tariffs and perhaps even drop them because it would give the United States a big foothold in global supply chains,” he said.
The CSIS said that Trump should revoke tariffs on African countries and that the African Union and African leaders “should seek to demonstrate that preferential trade with the continent, in fact, overall serves U.S. national interests.”
“Just like Canada and Mexico were exempt from the reciprocal tariffs due to the United States’ national interest, a similar case can be made for Africa in terms of market access and critical minerals supply chain security,” wrote economic development experts Hannah Ryder, Trevor Lwere, and Ovigwe Eguegu.
“As tariffs are set to hit U.S. firms in the automotive, aerospace, and chemical sectors, which are heavily dependent on critical minerals, the bulk of which Africa has, it is not in the U.S. interest to impose tariffs on African goods.”
Ryder, Lwere, and Eguegu highlighted that one of the Trump administration’s aims is to gain greater market access for American firms and products abroad.
“This requires the existence of purchasing power amongst foreign consumers. By imposing tariffs on African exports to the United States, however, the United States makes it difficult for Africa to obtain the purchasing power necessary to demand U.S. products,” they said.
The experts said the United States should support preferential access for African goods to the American market as a market-building strategy.
This is critical, they wrote, especially considering that Africa has the youngest population and will be home to over 25 percent of the global population in the next few decades.
Bamidele Ayemibo, lead trade policy consultant at Nigeria’s 3T Impex Consulting Limited, said African governments’ response to Trump’s tariffs should be to sign preferential trade agreements with the United States—and with other partners.
“The last thing they should do is retaliate with higher tariffs on U.S. products; they do not have the economic power to do so and they will only hurt themselves,” he told The Epoch Times.
“Now, more than ever, it is time for talk and for bargaining.”

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Defund The Cartels: A Smarter Plan For The Border&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/opinion/defund-the-cartels-a-smarter-plan-for-the-border-5844017?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Mollie Engelhart via The Epoch Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t fit neatly into a political box, especially when it comes to immigration. I’m a wife to a man who came here illegally at 16. I’ve taken legal guardianship of an unaccompanied minor and folded him into my family. I work in both hospitality and agriculture—industries that rely heavily on immigrant labor. My views on the border don’t align with any party line, and I’m aware that people on both sides of the aisle might find something in this article to disagree with. But that doesn’t make the conversation less necessary. It makes it more urgent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;America needs labor. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s not up for debate. We’ve raised a few generations of kids who are not equipped for hard, uncomfortable work—especially those who came of age during the pandemic. I’ve had over 350 employees at any one time in my businesses, and I’ve watched the workforce shift dramatically in just 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2889%29_5.jpg?itok=1gmAsNsb&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2889%29_5.jpg?itok=1gmAsNsb&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ca1514a5-86d5-4ea5-b2a9-a0ca8f381f88&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2889%29_5.jpg?itok=1gmAsNsb&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the same time, I believe a border wall is not racist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wall, like a fence or a locked front door, doesn’t carry moral weight. Strong borders make good neighbors. But let’s be honest: the southern border is already secured—just not by us. It’s secured by the Mexican cartels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every person crossing is paying $10,000 to $13,000 to make that journey—not including the pre-planned robbery that happens to nearly every person along the way, and sometimes additional financial extortion afterward. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not just turning a blind eye to this—we’re funding it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our labor shortage—our need for labor—is creating a massive revenue source for the cartels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many commentators scream, “Come legally!”—but the reality is, there are almost no viable legal pathways for Mexicans to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlike people from other countries, Mexicans cannot easily claim asylum. &lt;/strong&gt;Citizens of many Central and South American nations can claim asylum and stay in the United States while they await trial—a process that often takes five to 10 years. Even if their claim is denied, most never leave. Mexicans do not have this option. We are effectively prioritizing other nations over our immediate neighbor, and it makes no sense. We should be prioritizing Mexico first, and then Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humanitarian crisis is not what the media portrays. &lt;strong&gt;The real crisis is what happens before these people arrive - the women and children abused, trafficked, and disappeared in cartel territory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the man who hasn’t seen his mother in 20 years, or the woman who has children on both sides of the border and cannot return to see her children or grandchildren. She may never see her children here again. These are real stories. I live with them in my family and in my community. My husband didn’t see his mother for 12 years prior to marrying me and becoming an American citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, America is a melting pot. Yes, we welcome the tired and the poor. But no, we cannot take everyone. It’s not sustainable. And pretending otherwise only perpetuates suffering.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s create a 10-year low-skill work visa. It would cost $10,000 - money that currently goes to cartels. Workers would be permitted to come and go, visit family, and live with dignity. Employment would be mandatory; workers could not remain unemployed longer than three months. Applicants must have no criminal history. This visa would never lead to citizenship, even through marriage. The best case would be a green card, but not a vote. Workers would pay taxes and contribute $10 per paycheck to Social Security, which they would never draw from. After 10 years, the visa could be renewed once—or the worker could return home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We would prioritize Mexico, and then Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras—because a strong neighbor is national security. If your neighbor’s house is burning down, your own home is at risk.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong, thriving Mexico makes for a safer America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A healthy economy and stable society in the countries closest to us reduces pressure on our border and increases mutual prosperity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plan would dismantle the cartels’ business model, reunite families, end the incentive to bring children as props for border entry, and redirect billions of dollars from crime syndicates to the U.S. government. Migrants could fly directly into cities where jobs await—no more treacherous desert crossings or predatory smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One side of the aisle screams that we don’t want them—but still enjoys the literal fruits of their labor. The other side screams “humanitarian crisis” and “racism”—but takes no meaningful action, even when in power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, I believe there’s a solution that supports integrity for our border, for our businesses, for our families, and for our neighbors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But both sides of the aisle have not been interested in real solutions for a long time—and that begs the question: why? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the benefit of the gray? What is the benefit of a system that is clearly broken and leads to drugs, rape, murder, and chaos?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Defund The Cartels: A Smarter Plan For The Border

&lt;p&gt;This marked the &lt;strong&gt;14th consecutive year of population decline in the country, &lt;/strong&gt;according to a government estimate. The previous record drop was 861,000, reported in July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the largest demographic drop since 1968.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more details: according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, &lt;strong&gt;Japan’s total population was 123,802,000, &lt;/strong&gt;as of October 1, 2024, down by 550,000 or a 0.44% year-on-year decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/overall%20population.png?itok=dGhMXDR6&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/overall%20population.png?itok=dGhMXDR6&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;1e25e8b2-a3b1-485f-ae9a-dfd1c946e33b&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/overall%20population.png?itok=dGhMXDR6&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The population of only Japanese citizens was 120,296,000, plunging by 898,000, or a 0.74% YoY drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IMF projects that the total population will shrink by a further 3.5 million by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/japan%20population%20decline.jpg?itok=qVvnyreF&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/japan%20population%20decline.jpg?itok=qVvnyreF&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;0c20d27c-5846-479e-9967-0110ff15632a&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/japan%20population%20decline.jpg?itok=qVvnyreF&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural population decline, calculated by subtracting births from deaths, reached a record high of 890,000, rising for the eighteenth year running. This decline was 437,000 for women and 453,000 for men. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The silver lining: for the third straight year, there was a net increase in immigration, with 340,000 more people entering than leaving Japan. Which is good news for globalists: if they are so worried where to put all those African and Middle Eastern refugees who have swept across Europe sparking unprecedented blowback against establishment politics, there is always Japan... assuming the locals accept the flood of foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data underscore the country&apos;s unprecedented demographic crisis amid a rapidly aging society and collapsing birthrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan&apos;s total fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime -- fell to its lowest level in 2023 since records began in 1947, while the death/birth ratio at over 2.2, is the highest on record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/japan%20birth%20death.jpg?itok=BsJcZGof&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/japan%20birth%20death.jpg?itok=BsJcZGof&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;f35a8b31-8901-447b-a3e7-fd96a33b6cbe&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/japan%20birth%20death.jpg?itok=BsJcZGof&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures, released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, show that &lt;strong&gt;only Tokyo and neighboring Saitama prefecture registered population increases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By age group, the working population, consisting of people aged 15 to 64, stood at 73,728,000, a year-on-year decrease of 224,000, while the population aged 65 or older (red and orange in the figure below) increased by 17,000 to 36,243,000. Those 75 or older (red) increased by 700,000, to 20,777,000, and this age bracket now accounts for 57.3% of those aged 65 or older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the demographic crisis, the Japanese parliament passed a law in June 2024 aimed at reversing the falling birthrate. Measures under the law include expanded child allowances and enhanced parental leave benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.virginia.edu/content/tokyo-offering-workers-four-day-workweeks-increase-population&quot;&gt;beginning this month,&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;city government of Tokyo started offering its employees a four-day workweek, &lt;/strong&gt;hoping to increase the population and create a healthier work-life balance in a country notorious for long hours at the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials have warned that the period leading up to 2030 represents a critical window to address the trend. Late marriages, financial insecurity, and limited support for working parents are commonly cited as contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Japan Posts Record Population Drop, Shrinking For 14th Year, As Demographic Crisis Deepens

            
Japan&apos;s already collapsing population just posted its biggest annual drop on record, falling by 898,000 people as of last October compared to a year earlier, Kyodo News reported.
This marked the 14th consecutive year of population decline in the country, according to a government estimate. The previous record drop was 861,000, reported in July 2024.

Japan&apos;s total fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime -- fell to its lowest level in 2023 since records began in 1947, while the death/birth ratio at over 2.2, is the highest on record.



The figures, released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, show that only Tokyo and neighboring Saitama prefecture registered population increases.
By age group, the working population, consisting of people aged 15 to 64, stood at 73,728,000, a year-on-year decrease of 224,000, while the population aged 65 or older (red and orange in the figure below) increased by 17,000 to 36,243,000. Those 75 or older (red) increased by 700,000, to 20,777,000, and this age bracket now accounts for 57.3% of those aged 65 or older.
In response to the demographic crisis, the Japanese parliament passed a law in June 2024 aimed at reversing the falling birthrate. Measures under the law include expanded child allowances and enhanced parental leave benefits.
And beginning this month, the city government of Tokyo started offering its employees a four-day workweek, hoping to increase the population and create a healthier work-life balance in a country notorious for long hours at the office.
Officials have warned that the period leading up to 2030 represents a critical window to address the trend. Late marriages, financial insecurity, and limited support for working parents are commonly cited as contributing factors.

&lt;p&gt;While there is no specific catalyst for the suddenly collapse in the illiquid early Asian session, which sees many countries on extended Easter holiday, Bloomberg quotes traders that hedge funds are selling the dollar against virtually any currencies after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that President Donald Trump is still exploring ways to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The president and his team will continue to study that,” National Economic Council Director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-18/trump-studying-whether-removing-powell-is-option-hassett-says&quot;&gt;Kevin Hassett said Friday&lt;/a&gt; when asked by a reporter if removing Powell was an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hassett then suggested, accurately, that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The policy of this Federal Reserve was to raise rates the minute President Trump was elected last time, to say that the supply-side tax cuts that were going to be inflationary,” Hassett said, adding that Fed officials opted not to go “on TV and at IMF meetings and warn about the terrible inflation from the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden, and the obvious runaway spending from Joe Biden was textbook inflationary,” Hassett continued. “And then they cut rates right ahead of the election.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hassett, is of course, correct, as we first pointed out two weeks ago...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and as former NY Fed president Bill Dudley made crystal clear all the way back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since the market is terrified of the truth, especially if it means that Trump could take monetary policy actions into his own hands, the result has been a wholesale liquidation of all main currency pairs, with the EUR jumping to 3 year highs, even though Europe&apos;s economy remains an unmitigated disaster (Germany&apos;s upcoming debt spending spree notwithstanding), and even though the surge in the euro will make Europe&apos;s modest recession into a brutal one..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... the Yen surging 11% from its January lows, and at just over 141, the highest it has been against the dollar since the summer of 2023...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and, of course, gold which is storming to new record highs this evening, spiking above $3,373, its dip last week now a distant memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/gold%20usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=fWXgLfSJ&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/gold%20usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=fWXgLfSJ&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;085b99b0-98ad-4095-af14-4d3cfa11c1cd&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/gold%20usdjpy%20slump.jpg?itok=fWXgLfSJ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet none of these moves are surprising to anyone who read - as we repeatedly urged - the Miran Mar-A-Lago paper: yes, the plunge in the dollar is just what the admin quietly wants (they have repeatedly stated they want a strong dollar &quot;in the long term&quot;, but certainly not in the short, when the collapse in the greenback will boost US exports). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, if Powell will not cut rates to ease financial conditions, Trump&apos;s repeated browbeating of the Fed chair and threats to fire him will crash the dollar low enough to where Trump will get his financial easing one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there was one notable outlier in tonight&apos;s Dollar selloff: bitcoin. While previously any plunge in the dollar (and by extension surge in the yen) would batter what was little is left of the carry trade, hammering tech stocks and cryptos, tonight we finally saw a regime shift, and after flatlining initially, a burst of buying pushed bitcoin almost $2000 higher, above $87000, and its biggest one day move since Liberation Day...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and the result is that while bitcoin had generally tracked the DXY Dollar index lower for much of 2025, the last few weeks - and certainly Sunday night - have seen a very tangible snap in this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This breach in the right correlation between the two, suggests that with gold approaching ridiculous prices, the next flight to safety away from the collapsing dollar will be bitcoin - after all, &lt;strong&gt;it&apos;s only a matter of time before all other central banks unleash a money printing frenzy to hammer their own currencies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since all bitcoin needs is a little unexpected upside to spark a huge short squeeze and to get the momentum trades piling on, should today&apos;s phase reversal sustain for a few days, we may see new all time highs in bitcoin in a very short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait... because the real fun for non-fiat assets will start once other central banks - such as the BOJ and ECB - can no longer just sit and watch as the dollar disintegrates, pushing their own currencies into the stratosphere and killing their economies... and they retaliate by restarting the next round of global fiat debasement first by slashing rates and then by restarting the money printer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Dollar Crashes On Powell Removal Speculation, Gold Soars To All Time High And Bitcoin Suddenly Spikes

            
What was a miserable shortened week for the USD has gone from bad to worse in early Asia trading, when the Dollar index suddenly collapsed to a fresh 3 year low



While there is no specific catalyst for the suddenly collapse in the illiquid early Asian session, which sees many countries on extended Easter holiday, Bloomberg quotes traders that hedge funds are selling the dollar against virtually any currencies after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that President Donald Trump is still exploring ways to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to traders.

&lt;p&gt;But how much do Americans collectively spend on the goods and services they need? And what items draw the largest share? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualcapitalist.com/americas-19-trillion-consumer-economy-in-one-chart/&quot;&gt;Visual Capitalist&apos;s Pallavi Rao visualizes&lt;/a&gt; data from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/cex/pce-ce-distributions.htm&quot;&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt; for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/America-Consumer-Economy_web.jpg?itok=bS6WXUhL&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/America-Consumer-Economy_web.jpg?itok=bS6WXUhL&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;9c5234b3-a227-43ce-a34e-49b3f68420ee&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;650&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/America-Consumer-Economy_web.jpg?itok=bS6WXUhL&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Americans Spend Their Money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America’s consumer class spent nearly $19 trillion on goods and services in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, this was about 68% of the U.S. GDP that year. It was also larger than China’s overall GDP that year as well ($17.8T).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_10-50-49.jpg?itok=uIIGe8_G&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-04-20_10-50-49.jpg?itok=uIIGe8_G&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;67ab741d-82e8-4775-8b9b-97cdb5cb351d&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;379&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-04-20_10-50-49.jpg?itok=uIIGe8_G&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Housing and utilities&lt;/strong&gt; ($3.3T) and &lt;strong&gt;health care&lt;/strong&gt; ($3.1T) were the top household expenditure categories overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Americans spent the most money on groceries ($1.4T) in the goods category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the data isn’t as recent, other trends are visible: health care and housing expenditure have been trending up, clothing and food have been coming down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Pros and Cons of the Service Economy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tellingly, services account for nearly 70% of America’s personal consumption expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is matched by the supply side as well: nearly 80% of America’s jobs are in the service sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America’s transition away from manufacturing into services—both as producer and consumer—is a story with many episodes and arcs. While it has driven the growth of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualcapitalist.com/big-tech-companies-billions/&quot;&gt;high-value technology&lt;/a&gt; and financial companies, it has also resulted in the loss of blue-collar jobs in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This context is particularly relevant in the Trump administration’s second-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broad-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/trump-administration-tariffs-lawsuit&quot;&gt;tariffs on imported goods&lt;/a&gt; have been declared to reduce trade deficits and to incentivize companies to move their manufacturing back into the country. However, modern manufacturing is built off global supply chains and just-in-time shipping, and economists worry that the disruption will only raise prices for Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Visualizing America&apos;s $19 Trillion Consumer Economy In One Chart

            
To no one’s surprise, the world’s largest economy is also the world’s largest consumer economy.
But how much do Americans collectively spend on the goods and services they need? And what items draw the largest share? 
Visual Capitalist&apos;s Pallavi Rao visualizes data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for further analysis.



Where Americans Spend Their Money
America’s consumer class spent nearly $19 trillion on goods and services in 2023.
For context, this was about 68% of the U.S. GDP that year. It was also larger than China’s overall GDP that year as well ($17.8T).



Housing and utilities ($3.3T) and health care ($3.1T) were the top household expenditure categories overall.
Meanwhile, Americans spent the most money on groceries ($1.4T) in the goods category.
In case these numbers seem too big to comprehend, we’ve also broken down household expenditure by year and by month.
Comparative figures may vary as insurance expenditure can sometimes be included within a broader category (housing, transportation), or spun-off on its own.
In a similar vein, another graphic from eight years ago provides some other useful insights: how the share of each category’s expenditure has changed since the 1940s.
While the data isn’t as recent, other trends are visible: health care and housing expenditure have been trending up, clothing and food have been coming down.
The Pros and Cons of the Service Economy
Tellingly, services account for nearly 70% of America’s personal consumption expenditure.
This is matched by the supply side as well: nearly 80% of America’s jobs are in the service sector.
America’s transition away from manufacturing into services—both as producer and consumer—is a story with many episodes and arcs. While it has driven the growth of high-value technology and financial companies, it has also resulted in the loss of blue-collar jobs in America.
This context is particularly relevant in the Trump administration’s second-term.
Broad-based tariffs on imported goods have been declared to reduce trade deficits and to incentivize companies to move their manufacturing back into the country. However, modern manufacturing is built off global supply chains and just-in-time shipping, and economists worry that the disruption will only raise prices for Americans.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;US Housing Market May Finally See Relief As Foreign Buyers, Illegals And Airbnbs Disappear&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most detrimental consequences of the stagflationary surge in the US since 2020 was the meteoric rise in housing prices, from rentals to purchases to mortgages, across all markets.  At present the cost of housing stands at around 30% of the average American&apos;s income, with home prices and rentals seeing at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS&quot;&gt;a 60% increase&lt;/a&gt; in only 5 years.  In high traffic markets the prices have jumped far higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation in fixed expenses like housing, utilities, gasoline, food, etc. directly reduce disposable income which forces consumers to cut back on retail and recreational purchases.  Higher prices in retail goods can be weathered through savings and spending adaptation, higher prices in fixed expenses is much more difficult to deal with and the results are hard to miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may, however, be a light at the end of the tunnel with new developments suggesting a decline in housing costs is on the way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/total-housing-inventory&quot;&gt;US Existing Home Inventory&lt;/a&gt; is back on the rise after hitting rock bottom in 2022, with a considerable jump occurring in the year (February numbers indicate a 17% jump since 2024).  This is partially because incredibly high prices driving down purchases, but recent events indicate that the inventory trend is going to accelerate in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/UShousing1.jpeg?itok=7BAdC5AZ&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/UShousing1.jpeg?itok=7BAdC5AZ&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;c4381e61-48b6-4230-84ab-4cca6b90e8bf&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/UShousing1.jpeg?itok=7BAdC5AZ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Buyers Exiting The US Market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first actions of the Biden Administration in the face of the housing crisis should have been to enact a moratorium on foreign purchases of US properties.  This didn&apos;t happen, of course, but the tides may be shifting in favor of US buyers in the near term/ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian real estate investors and &quot;Snow Birds&quot; using secondary properties in the US as vacation homes are now reportedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/30/business/canada-snowbirds-trump-trade-war-tariffs/index.html&quot;&gt;selling off their holdings&lt;/a&gt; in light of the Trump Administration&apos;s tariff blitz.  America&apos;s socialist neighbors to the north are apparently cashing out at record pace.  Oddly, Canadian property owners say they&apos;re &quot;afraid of anti-Canadian sentiment&quot; in the US as the reason for dumping their second homes.  The US and foreign media have these people terrified that there&apos;s a wave of &quot;Canadian hate&quot; rolling through the American heartland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t happening, but on the bright side this frees up a considerable number of homes for the US market and will ultimately help to lower prices.  Canadians are the largest foreign property buyers, taking up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/canadians-sell-us-vacation-homes-propertie-3c3676e8&quot;&gt;at least 13%&lt;/a&gt; of all home purchases in the US in 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not just Canadians exiting, though. Chinese and European buyers are backing off with some states moving to block property purchases by foreign interests and hysteria over America-first nationalism frightening prospective investors.  Ultimately, this is a net positive for Americans desperate for some relief in a home market that the vast majority of citizens cannot afford.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deportations And Falling Rental Prices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be true that most illegal aliens don&apos;t buy houses, but they certainly take a massive bite out of available rentals.  With an estimate 17 million to 20 million illegals in the US at the time Joe Biden left the White House and a shortage of at least 11 million houses as of 2024, the obvious solution would be to kick out as many migrants as possible to free up the rental market.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may have already begun.  Trump border restrictions and changes to immigration policy have been wildly successful in cutting illegal border crossing.  In March, Border Patrol reported a 95% drop in encounters on the southern border, an epic decline from the Biden Administration.  ICE also reports that they have deported &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2025/03/31/us-news/ice-arrested-113k-deported-over-100k-since-trumps-return-as-prez-maintains-promise-to-boot-illegal-migrants-alleged-gangbangers-sources/&quot;&gt;at least 100,000&lt;/a&gt; and arrested 13,000 others since Trump took office.  Some skeptics might argue that this is nowhere near enough, but it does not account for the millions of migrants that are self deporting.       &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least 900,000 migrants that entered the US under Biden&apos;s CBP One App have been ordered to self deport are or be arrested in the coming months.  US rental prices have been cooling for the past year, but much too slowly.  The drop in housing demand by illegals is expected to create a larger availability pool by the end of 2025, though some leftist media outlets assert that the loss of illegals will cause a decline in home construction and hurt the market instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airbnb Bonanza Fizzles And Opens The Market To 2 million Homes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Airbnb craze has been dying for at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/airbnb-revenue-collapse-housing-market-crash-fears-1809543&quot;&gt;the past two years&lt;/a&gt;.  High property taxes, declining revenues, skyrocketing insurance rates and a drop in tourism means the potential for profits is getting slimmer by the month.  With over 2.4 million homes listed as Airbnb rentals in the US right now, there&apos;s a good chance these properties will end up for sale or as long term rentals by the end of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall trend is deflationary, which is likely to scare a lot of people, but without this is necessary for any return to affordability in housing. Supply must increase in order to offset demand. Unless there are some dramatic changes soon, millions of Americans may be priced out of a home entirely. &lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Bush-Era Swamp Creature Revealed To Be Key Figure In OKC Bombing Coverup&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As I have always said:  The only difference between the KGB and the FBI is that the KGB has never claimed to be a legitimate law enforcement agency.” ~ Jesse Trentadue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers may know the name John Ashcroft, attorney general under George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/john-ashcroft-3_0.jpg?itok=wPxagTnG&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/john-ashcroft-3_0.jpg?itok=wPxagTnG&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;8e11f699-fa6f-4fe1-b056-7033ac5a1824&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/john-ashcroft-3_0.jpg?itok=wPxagTnG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, good old&lt;strong&gt; Ashcroft was at the heart of a high profile cover-up: the Oklahoma City bombing&lt;/strong&gt;, according to attorney Jesse Trentadue.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The following comes from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kennethtrentadue.com/pdf/info1.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;court filing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provided to ZeroHedge by Trentadue, attorney to OKC bombing accomplice Terry Nichols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context (per Jesse from &lt;a href=&quot;http://kennethtrentadue.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;kennethtrentadue.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;em&gt;Jesse is the brother of Kenneth Michael Trentadue who died in August 1995, while incarcerated at the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Following the death, the Department of Justice (DOJ) immediately deemed it a suicide, denied the medical examiner access to the cell where Kenneth Trentadue was killed, ordered the cell cleaned and painted, and repeatedly asked both the medical examiner and Kenneth Trentadue’s family to authorize the cremation of his body. The medical examiner could not legally authorize cremation and the family refused, demanding that Kenneth&apos;s body be returned to them. When Trentadue&apos;s body was returned to the family, they removed heavy makeup and discovered bruises all over his body, from head to foot. The bruises, cuts, and other wounds depicted an obvious beating and murder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the story…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While serving his prison sentence, Nichols attempted to spark an investigation into FBI involvement in the OKC bombing. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://kennethtrentadue.com/pdf/letter1.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;sent a letter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stating that he could provide such information to the then head of the DOJ Ashcroft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashcroft did not respond to the letter but immediately forbade the media from speaking to Nichols, which resulted in 60 Minutes cancelling a sit-down interview they had scheduled with Nichols, says Trentadue. &lt;/strong&gt;Shortly thereafter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kennethtrentadue.com/pdf/info2.pdf&quot;&gt;Nichols said&lt;/a&gt; he received a visit from a man presenting an offer from the DOJ to undo Nichols’ death sentence if he agreed to three conditions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take ownership of an anonymous warning the DOJ received saying the Murrah Building was bombed 30 minutes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it actually had been.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Implicate Nichols’ own brother in the bombing plot.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reveal the location of the “Kinestick”, an explosive used in the bombing. Nichols mentioned having knowledge of an unused stache in his letter to Ashcroft. The existence of a remaining stache was&lt;strong&gt; not known at the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existence of the mysterious call was independently corroborated in Stephen Jones’ book &lt;i&gt;Others Unknown&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and even covered by ABC News: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;ABC News 20/20 reports on how someone called the Executive Secretariat in DC about a half hour before the OKC bombing and said &quot;the Murrah building has just been bombed&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/XzMTFiCG6r&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/XzMTFiCG6r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Richard ✞ (@okc_facts) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/okc_facts/status/1913635437945737222?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 19, 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was discovered that the DOJ proxy (Michael Selby) who visited Nichols &lt;strong&gt;previously worked in Ashcroft’s private security detail. &lt;/strong&gt;Trentadue helped to further corroborate that this meeting took place by telling ZH:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the declaration was filed, Selby called me upset as hell.  &lt;strong&gt;Said that I had just got him “fucking killed.” &lt;/strong&gt; The attorney who brought Selby into meet Nichols is Rodney Uphoff.  A law professor at the University of Missouri.  I called Uphoff and he confirmed the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is strange that such an offer – giving leniency to an accomplice to one of the most horrific domestic terrorist attacks in U.S. history – would be presented by someone who does not work at the DOJ and &lt;strong&gt;stipulate that Nichol take credit for an anonymous tip which he did not make. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nichols ultimately did not accept the deal because he did not want to throw his brother under the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story, now part of official record thanks to Trentadue, serves as an interesting look into the true conspiracies that Ashcroft may have had a hand in.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Bush-Era Swamp Creature Revealed To Be Key Figure In OKC Bombing Coverup

            
“As I have always said:  The only difference between the KGB and the FBI is that the KGB has never claimed to be a legitimate law enforcement agency.” ~ Jesse Trentadue
Readers may know the name John Ashcroft, attorney general under George W. Bush.



Well, good old Ashcroft was at the heart of a high profile cover-up: the Oklahoma City bombing, according to attorney Jesse Trentadue. The following comes from a court filing provided to ZeroHedge by Trentadue, attorney to OKC bombing accomplice Terry Nichols.
For context (per Jesse from kennethtrentadue.com): Jesse is the brother of Kenneth Michael Trentadue who died in August 1995, while incarcerated at the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Following the death, the Department of Justice (DOJ) immediately deemed it a suicide, denied the medical examiner access to the cell where Kenneth Trentadue was killed, ordered the cell cleaned and painted, and repeatedly asked both the medical examiner and Kenneth Trentadue’s family to authorize the cremation of his body. The medical examiner could not legally authorize cremation and the family refused, demanding that Kenneth&apos;s body be returned to them. When Trentadue&apos;s body was returned to the family, they removed heavy makeup and discovered bruises all over his body, from head to foot. The bruises, cuts, and other wounds depicted an obvious beating and murder.
Now for the story…
While serving his prison sentence, Nichols attempted to spark an investigation into FBI involvement in the OKC bombing. He sent a letter stating that he could provide such information to the then head of the DOJ Ashcroft.
Ashcroft did not respond to the letter but immediately forbade the media from speaking to Nichols, which resulted in 60 Minutes cancelling a sit-down interview they had scheduled with Nichols, says Trentadue. Shortly thereafter, Nichols said he received a visit from a man presenting an offer from the DOJ to undo Nichols’ death sentence if he agreed to three conditions:
Take ownership of an anonymous warning the DOJ received saying the Murrah Building was bombed 30 minutes before it actually had been.
Implicate Nichols’ own brother in the bombing plot.
Reveal the location of the “Kinestick”, an explosive used in the bombing. Nichols mentioned having knowledge of an unused stache in his letter to Ashcroft. The existence of a remaining stache was not known at the time.
The existence of the mysterious call was independently corroborated in Stephen Jones’ book Others Unknown and even covered by ABC News: 
ABC News 20/20 reports on how someone called the Executive Secretariat in DC about a half hour before the OKC bombing and said &quot;the Murrah building has just been bombed&quot; pic.twitter.com/XzMTFiCG6r
April 19, 2025

It was discovered that the DOJ proxy (Michael Selby) who visited Nichols previously worked in Ashcroft’s private security detail. Trentadue helped to further corroborate that this meeting took place by telling ZH:
After the declaration was filed, Selby called me upset as hell.  Said that I had just got him “fucking killed.”  The attorney who brought Selby into meet Nichols is Rodney Uphoff.  A law professor at the University of Missouri.  I called Uphoff and he confirmed the event.
It is strange that such an offer – giving leniency to an accomplice to one of the most horrific domestic terrorist attacks in U.S. history – would be presented by someone who does not work at the DOJ and stipulate that Nichol take credit for an anonymous tip which he did not make. 
Nichols ultimately did not accept the deal because he did not want to throw his brother under the bus.
The story, now part of official record thanks to Trentadue, serves as an interesting look into the true conspiracies that Ashcroft may have had a hand in.

And for a great interview where Trentadue discusses the contents of this article and more, listen to friend-of-ZeroHedge Scott Horton interview Jesse just last month.
As for Ashcroft, after &apos;retiring&apos; he started a private lobbying firm that quickly secured the Israeli government as its first client.

&lt;p&gt;Four American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) affiliates filed a lawsuit on April 18 asking a federal court to reinstate the legal status of international students who have had their visas revoked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2888%29_5.jpg?itok=OypBxtmn&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2888%29_5.jpg?itok=OypBxtmn&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;9abcef4c-6926-463b-96d8-4d9ac0a92c4a&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2888%29_5.jpg?itok=OypBxtmn&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple ACLU affiliates and the law firm Shaheen &amp; Gordon filed a federal class action &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riaclu.org/en/cases/pasula-v-department-homeland-security&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; representing more than 100 foreign students in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, and Puerto Rico who &lt;strong&gt;they say had their F-1 student immigration status “unlawfully and abruptly terminated with no specified reason as to why.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students include several at Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design, who had their student status revoked in recent weeks. The lawsuit asks the court to reinstate their F-1 student status, which would allow them to continue their studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“International students are a vital community in our state’s universities, and no administration should be allowed to circumvent the law to unilaterally strip students of status, disrupt their studies, and put them at risk of deportation,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Gilles Bissonnette, legal director of the ACLU of New Hampshire, said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riaclu.org/en/news/aclu-files-class-action-lawsuit-challenging-terminated-student-status-students-new-hampshire&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several students have already sued, arguing they were denied due process. In New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Montana, federal judges have granted temporary restraining orders to shield the students from deportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the April 18 lawsuit, which was filed in New Hampshire federal court, the affected students said they were not notified before their F-1 student statuses were canceled, opening them up to deportation and preventing them from finishing their studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complaint states that one of the students, Manikanta Pasula of India, was close to finishing his master’s in computer science at New Hampshire’s Rivier University and was working to apply for an international student work program that would allow him to stay in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another student, Hangrui Zhang of China, was in a Ph.D. program in electronic and computer science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, and says he now can no longer work as a research assistant, his only income source, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lawyers representing the students said the government did not give the required advance notice, informing the foreign students that their legal status would be terminated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 27, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department may have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/rubio-says-us-may-have-revoked-more-than-300-visas-5832536&quot;&gt;revoked&lt;/a&gt; more than 300 visas so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Rubio said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He said the reason is ”because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we’re not going to give you a visa.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rubio said he is canceling visas for those who were acting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/ice-arrests-palestinian-green-card-holder-who-led-columbia-university-protest-5822800&quot;&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt; to national interests, such as those who had protested Israel and its military action in Gaza or others facing criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One high-profile case included former Columbia University graduate student and activist Mahmoud Khalil, who was slated for deportation after leading several pro-Palestinian protests on campus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Inflation Risk Is Subsiding Rapidly&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/inflation-risk-is-subsiding-rapidly/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation risk has been a significant topic of discussion in the mainstream media for the last few years. Such is unsurprising given that inflation spiked following the pandemic in 2020 as consumer spending &lt;em&gt;(demand)&lt;/em&gt; was shot into overdrive from stimulus payments and production &lt;em&gt;(supply)&lt;/em&gt; was shuttered. To understand why that occurred, we need to revisit &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/do-money-supply-deficit-and-qe-create-inflation/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Economics 101.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In economics, &lt;strong&gt;inflation&lt;/strong&gt; is a general increase in the prices of goods and services. Changes in inflation are a function of fluctuations in actual demand for goods and services (also known as demand shocks, including changes in fiscal or monetary policy or recession), changes in available supplies such as during energy crises (also known as supply shocks), or changes in inflation expectations, which may be self-fulfilling. Note that supply and demand are key facets of the inflation equation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic economics states prices will be set at a level where the supply of goods or services meets consumer demand.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Supply-Demand-Chart-070522_2.jpg?itok=2GdiP8y0&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Supply-Demand-Chart-070522_2.jpg?itok=2GdiP8y0&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;9d6286a7-74f6-436d-b87a-f221d67046e9&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;331&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Supply-Demand-Chart-070522_2.jpg?itok=2GdiP8y0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic illustration shows this basic principle taught in every &lt;em&gt;“Econ 101”&lt;/em&gt; class. &lt;strong&gt;As noted, in 2020, inflation was the consequence of restricting supply and massively increasing demand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That massive surge in stimulus sent directly to households resulted in an unprecedented spike in &lt;em&gt;“savings,&lt;/em&gt;” creating artificial demand. As shown, the &lt;em&gt;“pig in the python”&lt;/em&gt; effect is evident. Over the next two years, that &lt;em&gt;“bulge”&lt;/em&gt; of excess liquidity has reverted to the previous growth trend. Given that economic growth lags behind the reversion in savings by about 12 months, we should continue to see economic growth slow into 2025. Notably, the &lt;em&gt;“lag effect”&lt;/em&gt; is critical to the &lt;em&gt;“inflation risk”&lt;/em&gt; thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-116-1024x625.jpg?itok=hOzn9Rn9&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-116-1024x625.jpg?itok=hOzn9Rn9&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;995cf8ed-9da2-4f45-a28c-d4b697cedd82&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;305&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-116-1024x625.jpg?itok=hOzn9Rn9&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding that inflation is solely a function of supply and demand, the ongoing reversal of monetary liquidity is continuing to erode economic activity. Notably, what caused the inflation spike post-2020 was not an increase in the debt or the Federal Reserve but rather the temporary increase in the money supply caused by sending checks to households. &lt;strong&gt;Therefore, the inflation risk will continue to subside unless the government passes a new infrastructure spending bill of massive proportions or sends another stimulus to households.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But Lance, tariffs are inflationary.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They aren’t for two reasons, and it all starts with consumer confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-consumer-is-the-key-to-inflation-risk&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumer Is The Key To Inflation Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand the basic assumption that if you impose a tax on a product, good, or service, then the &lt;em&gt;“cost”&lt;/em&gt; of that product, good, or service will increase, hence the inflation risk. While that is perfectly logical, it excludes two crucial factors: &lt;em&gt;1) Only producers pay the “tax” from tariffs, and 2) we measure inflation (in terms of CPI) from the consumer side of the equation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/the-tariff-risk-isnt-in-inflation-part-ii/&quot;&gt;“Tariffs Aren’t An Inflation Risk,”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; we discussed tariffs’ impact on the production side of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Post-pandemic demand surges, supply chain disruptions, and massive fiscal and monetary interventions supported those elevated margins. As evidenced by the chart below, the correlation between economic growth rates and corporate profits is high. Note that outliers of the correlation are historically related to events such as the “Financial Crisis” and post-recession economic recoveries.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corporations react to cost increases in their business (i.e., wages, benefits, commodities, utilities, etc.), which must be factored into the selling price to maintain profitability. &lt;strong&gt;Crucially, corporations can only pass on higher input costs to consumers if demand remains higher than the available supply of those goods or services.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2020 and 2021, corporations could pass on most of the inflationary increase to consumers as they were willing to spend the Government’s money. However, as excess savings run out, inflation declines as consumers decrease spending; corporate profits weaken as the ability to pass on higher input costs to customers fades. As shown, as inflation declines, the rate of change in corporate profits also weakens.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read that bolded sentence again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When discussing inflation risk, consumer activity drives inflationary pulses in the economy. If we use a two-year average of corporate profits minus inflation, we can visualize that impact. As shown, inflationary increases, like tariffs, are only inflationary in the economy if they can be passed onto the consumer. Inflation surged in 2020 as corporations could pass on the bulk of the cost increases to consumers flush with cash. Today, to consumers. Today, inflation is declining due to declining demand. As such, the percentage of cost increases corporations must absorb is increasing, which reduces corporate profitability but shows up in the economy as slowing inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-117-1024x649.jpg?itok=fR5qCBSL&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-117-1024x649.jpg?itok=fR5qCBSL&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;73f099e1-1b46-4d56-9ffd-be95acb8db4c&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;317&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-117-1024x649.jpg?itok=fR5qCBSL&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the crucial point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Corporations don’t create inflation. They merely react to changes in demand and adjust pricing and supply to maintain profitability. When the consumer slows down, corporations cut prices to reduce supply.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we should expect, consumer actions, which is how we measure inflation through the consumer price index (CPI), drive inflation risk. Consumer confidence is the key to understanding whether inflation risk is present in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-consumers-lack-confidence&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumers Lack Confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the commentary about tariff-related inflation risk, inflation is hard to achieve if consumers are unwilling or, more importantly, unable to pay higher prices. As noted in this past week’s commentary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/the-consumer-is-tapping-out/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Consumers Are Tapping Out,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; consumers show signs of deep financial stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“At the heart of the problem is the collapse of household balance sheets in the lower-income and middle-income brackets. These groups have depleted the excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and are turning to high-interest borrowing to bridge the gap. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported that the share of active credit card accounts making only minimum payments surged to 10.75% in Q3 2024—a record high. This statistic isn’t just a warning about credit health; it points to widespread cash flow stress.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-69%20%281%29.jpg?itok=wOQBByWs&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-69%20%281%29.jpg?itok=wOQBByWs&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;1fa1344d-df99-4ab6-9f45-f0b79a216a78&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;305&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-69%20%281%29.jpg?itok=wOQBByWs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, consumer confidence in finding employment continues to erode as the economy slows. Given that employment creates income for consumption, it is difficult to expand consumption (demand) if consumers do not have a job, fear losing their jobs, or wage growth stagnates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-119-1024x643.jpg?itok=VwOVcDCP&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-119-1024x643.jpg?itok=VwOVcDCP&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;3705c94a-2a6b-4ddc-a3e4-2c2d6fc86a00&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;314&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-119-1024x643.jpg?itok=VwOVcDCP&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can investigate this further by examining Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), which comprise nearly 70% of the economic equation. Historically, when consumer confidence is declining, consumption also slows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-120-1024x662.jpg?itok=6UYvwhPP&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-120-1024x662.jpg?itok=6UYvwhPP&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;cb250a71-f379-4df4-9e40-28d7ac25c99d&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;323&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-120-1024x662.jpg?itok=6UYvwhPP&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, it is unsurprising that inflation is tied to consumer confidence. As consumer confidence declines, the demand for goods and services also declines. The reduction in economic activity shows up in the current inflation risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image-121-1024x661.jpg?itok=tOjbgrX-&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image-121-1024x661.jpg?itok=tOjbgrX-&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;83b5bec6-e5af-40ea-8a76-72a03083228a&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;323&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image-121-1024x661.jpg?itok=tOjbgrX-&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Consumer stress isn’t limited to anecdotal indicators—it shows up in corporate earnings and executive commentary. During the company’s earnings call, Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart, stated that many customers are under “budget pressure.” They also exhibit “&lt;em&gt;stressed behaviors,”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; including spending reductions across general merchandise. &lt;/strong&gt;Specifically, he warned that &lt;em&gt;“For many customers, the money runs out before the month does.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos painted an equally concerning picture. He described his customers as &lt;em&gt;“struggling more than ever before&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt; Todd added that &lt;strong&gt;some are now forgoing non-discretionary items&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;like medication or hygiene products&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;to afford groceries and fuel.&lt;/strong&gt; He&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;said, &lt;em&gt;“These customers are making trade-offs we haven’t seen in years.”&lt;/em&gt; Concurring with that warning was Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup. She observed that consumers are &lt;em&gt;“becoming more cautious”&lt;/em&gt; and focusing spending on smaller, lower-cost purchases. While this signals a growing defensive posture, often associated with recessionary conditions, they are also deflationary. &lt;strong&gt;When consumer behavior shifts en masse from aspirational to survival-based, the ripple effects are inevitable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that inflation risks are extremely muted given the rapidly slowing economic backdrop and disruption in the stock and bond markets, which also impact consumer confidence. Could that change? Yes, but such a change would require a reinstatement of stimulus checks, a surge in Government spending, and the Federal Reserve increasing monetary policy. For now, none of those are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant risk to the economy is not the return of inflation risks but rather the collapse in consumer confidence that leads to a recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may have that data showing up sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Inflation Risk Is Subsiding Rapidly

            
Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com,
Inflation risk has been a significant topic of discussion in the mainstream media for the last few years. Such is unsurprising given that inflation spiked following the pandemic in 2020 as consumer spending (demand) was shot into overdrive from stimulus payments and production (supply) was shuttered. To understand why that occurred, we need to revisit “Economics 101.”
“In economics, inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services. Changes in inflation are a function of fluctuations in actual demand for goods and services (also known as demand shocks, including changes in fiscal or monetary policy or recession), changes in available supplies such as during energy crises (also known as supply shocks), or changes in inflation expectations, which may be self-fulfilling. Note that supply and demand are key facets of the inflation equation.
Basic economics states prices will be set at a level where the supply of goods or services meets consumer demand.”



The economic illustration shows this basic principle taught in every “Econ 101” class. As noted, in 2020, inflation was the consequence of restricting supply and massively increasing demand.
That massive surge in stimulus sent directly to households resulted in an unprecedented spike in “savings,” creating artificial demand. As shown, the “pig in the python” effect is evident. Over the next two years, that “bulge” of excess liquidity has reverted to the previous growth trend. Given that economic growth lags behind the reversion in savings by about 12 months, we should continue to see economic growth slow into 2025. Notably, the “lag effect” is critical to the “inflation risk” thesis.



Understanding that inflation is solely a function of supply and demand, the ongoing reversal of monetary liquidity is continuing to erode economic activity. Notably, what caused the inflation spike post-2020 was not an increase in the debt or the Federal Reserve but rather the temporary increase in the money supply caused by sending checks to households. Therefore, the inflation risk will continue to subside unless the government passes a new infrastructure spending bill of massive proportions or sends another stimulus to households.
“But Lance, tariffs are inflationary.”
They aren’t for two reasons, and it all starts with consumer confidence.
Consumer Is The Key To Inflation Risk
I understand the basic assumption that if you impose a tax on a product, good, or service, then the “cost” of that product, good, or service will increase, hence the inflation risk. While that is perfectly logical, it excludes two crucial factors: 1) Only producers pay the “tax” from tariffs, and 2) we measure inflation (in terms of CPI) from the consumer side of the equation.
In “Tariffs Aren’t An Inflation Risk,” we discussed tariffs’ impact on the production side of the equation.
“Post-pandemic demand surges, supply chain disruptions, and massive fiscal and monetary interventions supported those elevated margins. As evidenced by the chart below, the correlation between economic growth rates and corporate profits is high. Note that outliers of the correlation are historically related to events such as the “Financial Crisis” and post-recession economic recoveries.”



Corporations react to cost increases in their business (i.e., wages, benefits, commodities, utilities, etc.), which must be factored into the selling price to maintain profitability. Crucially, corporations can only pass on higher input costs to consumers if demand remains higher than the available supply of those goods or services. In 2020 and 2021, corporations could pass on most of the inflationary increase to consumers as they were willing to spend the Government’s money. However, as excess savings run out, inflation declines as consumers decrease spending; corporate profits weaken as the ability to pass on higher input costs to customers fades. As shown, as inflation declines, the rate of change in corporate profits also weakens.”
Read that bolded sentence again.
When discussing inflation risk, consumer activity drives inflationary pulses in the economy. If we use a two-year average of corporate profits minus inflation, we can visualize that impact. As shown, inflationary increases, like tariffs, are only inflationary in the economy if they can be passed onto the consumer. Inflation surged in 2020 as corporations could pass on the bulk of the cost increases to consumers flush with cash. Today, to consumers. Today, inflation is declining due to declining demand. As such, the percentage of cost increases corporations must absorb is increasing, which reduces corporate profitability but shows up in the economy as slowing inflation.



Here is the crucial point:
“Corporations don’t create inflation. They merely react to changes in demand and adjust pricing and supply to maintain profitability. When the consumer slows down, corporations cut prices to reduce supply.”
As we should expect, consumer actions, which is how we measure inflation through the consumer price index (CPI), drive inflation risk. Consumer confidence is the key to understanding whether inflation risk is present in the economy.
Consumers Lack Confidence
Despite all the commentary about tariff-related inflation risk, inflation is hard to achieve if consumers are unwilling or, more importantly, unable to pay higher prices. As noted in this past week’s commentary, “Consumers Are Tapping Out,” consumers show signs of deep financial stress.
“At the heart of the problem is the collapse of household balance sheets in the lower-income and middle-income brackets. These groups have depleted the excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and are turning to high-interest borrowing to bridge the gap. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported that the share of active credit card accounts making only minimum payments surged to 10.75% in Q3 2024—a record high. This statistic isn’t just a warning about credit health; it points to widespread cash flow stress.“



Furthermore, consumer confidence in finding employment continues to erode as the economy slows. Given that employment creates income for consumption, it is difficult to expand consumption (demand) if consumers do not have a job, fear losing their jobs, or wage growth stagnates.



We can investigate this further by examining Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), which comprise nearly 70% of the economic equation. Historically, when consumer confidence is declining, consumption also slows.



As such, it is unsurprising that inflation is tied to consumer confidence. As consumer confidence declines, the demand for goods and services also declines. The reduction in economic activity shows up in the current inflation risks.



Conclusion
Lastly, Consumer stress isn’t limited to anecdotal indicators—it shows up in corporate earnings and executive commentary. During the company’s earnings call, Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart, stated that many customers are under “budget pressure.” They also exhibit “stressed behaviors,” including spending reductions across general merchandise. Specifically, he warned that “For many customers, the money runs out before the month does.”
Similarly, Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos painted an equally concerning picture. He described his customers as “struggling more than ever before.” Todd added that some are now forgoing non-discretionary items, like medication or hygiene products, to afford groceries and fuel. He said, “These customers are making trade-offs we haven’t seen in years.” Concurring with that warning was Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup. She observed that consumers are “becoming more cautious” and focusing spending on smaller, lower-cost purchases. While this signals a growing defensive posture, often associated with recessionary conditions, they are also deflationary. When consumer behavior shifts en masse from aspirational to survival-based, the ripple effects are inevitable.
The bottom line is that inflation risks are extremely muted given the rapidly slowing economic backdrop and disruption in the stock and bond markets, which also impact consumer confidence. Could that change? Yes, but such a change would require a reinstatement of stimulus checks, a surge in Government spending, and the Federal Reserve increasing monetary policy. For now, none of those are available.
The most significant risk to the economy is not the return of inflation risks but rather the collapse in consumer confidence that leads to a recession.
We may have that data showing up sooner than later.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;China Tests Novel Non-Nuclear Hydrogen Bomb - Generates Intense Fireball&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese scientists successfully detonated a powerful and innovative &lt;u&gt;non-nuclear&lt;/u&gt; hydrogen-based bomb that produced an enduring, intensely-hot fireball&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3307059/china-tests-non-nuclear-hydrogen-bomb-science-paper-shows?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=homepage&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported on Sunday, citing a research paper describing the experiment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new technology centers on the use of &lt;strong&gt;magnesium hydride (MgH2), a white or silvery crystalline powder that&apos;s capable of storing an outsize amount of hydrogen&lt;/strong&gt;. The material and its extraordinary solid-state storage potential originally piqued scientists&apos; interest for a peaceful purpose: transporting hydrogen to off-grid locations for use generating &lt;strong&gt;clean energy&lt;/strong&gt; and heat by way of fuel cells. Magnesium hydride&apos;s storage capacity is far superior to pressurized tanks, &lt;em&gt;SCMP&lt;/em&gt; explains. The material is also of interest to scientists in the field of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385632642_Using_magnesium_hydride_as_the_future_dual-mode_propellant_for_spacecraft_A_simulation_investigation&quot;&gt;spacecraft propulsion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, scientists recognized that &lt;strong&gt;densely-packed hydrogen offers extraordinary explosive potential&lt;/strong&gt;, and set out to build explosive devices to measure the destructive force. China&apos;s pioneering evaluation started small, with a test bomb weighing just 4.4 pounds (2kg). The resulting fireball impressed researchers, producing heat exceeding 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 Celsius). More importantly, &lt;strong&gt;the fireball lasted more than two seconds, which is 15 times longer than a comparably-scaled TNT explosion&lt;/strong&gt;. No nuclear materials were involved.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The test bomb was produced by the the 705 Research Institute&lt;/strong&gt;, a subsidiary operation of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). Among its many scientific endeavors, the 705 Research Institute is a leading force in China&apos;s development of underwater weapon systems. However, &lt;strong&gt;the bomb test was conducted on land&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;SCMP&lt;/em&gt;&apos;s summary of the paper didn&apos;t address any naval-kinetic-warfare implications; however, magnesium hydride is being eyed for possible use in submarine fuel cells. The peer-reviewed paper on the innovative bomb appeared in the Chinese-language Journal of Projectiles, Rockets, Missiles and Guidance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Hydrogen gas explosions ignite with minimal ignition energy, have a broad explosion range, and unleash flames that race outward rapidly while spreading widely,&lt;/strong&gt;” the research team in a peer-reviewed paper published by the Chinese-language &lt;em&gt;Journal of Projectiles, Rockets, Missiles and Guidance&lt;/em&gt;. “This combination allows &lt;strong&gt;precise control over blast intensity, easily achieving uniform destruction of targets across vast areas&lt;/strong&gt;.” In addition to that use, the 705 Research Institute&apos;s scientists also evaluated the bomb&apos;s potential use in confined attacks on high-value targets. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Producing magnesium hydride is no easy feat&lt;/strong&gt;, as the process of binding of hydrogen and magnesium necessitates high pressures and high temperatures. If air manages to infiltrate the production chamber, the facility and its workers could be incinerated in the blink of an eye. Given the demands, it can take a laboratory a full day just to generate a few grams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, however, &lt;strong&gt;China is shifting magnesium hydride production from the micro-scale of laboratories to the industrial scale of a factory &lt;/strong&gt;in the Shaanxi province in the country&apos;s northwest. Aiming to pump out a jaw-dropping &lt;strong&gt;150 tons per year, &lt;/strong&gt;the plant is the work of the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/research_news/chem/202501/t20250115_898687.shtml&quot;&gt;completed its one-year pilot phase&lt;/a&gt; on January 10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under constrained detonation, peak overpressure reached 428.43 kilopascals at two metres (6ft 7in) from the bomb – about &lt;strong&gt;40 per cent of TNT’s blast force, but with a far greater heat projection range&lt;/strong&gt;... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The chain reaction begins when detonation shock waves fracture magnesium hydride into micron-scale particles, exposing fresh surfaces&lt;/strong&gt;, according to the study.

      <contentSnippet>China Tests Novel Non-Nuclear Hydrogen Bomb - Generates Intense Fireball

            
Chinese scientists successfully detonated a powerful and innovative non-nuclear hydrogen-based bomb that produced an enduring, intensely-hot fireball, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, citing a research paper describing the experiment. 
The new technology centers on the use of magnesium hydride (MgH2), a white or silvery crystalline powder that&apos;s capable of storing an outsize amount of hydrogen. The material and its extraordinary solid-state storage potential originally piqued scientists&apos; interest for a peaceful purpose: transporting hydrogen to off-grid locations for use generating clean energy and heat by way of fuel cells. Magnesium hydride&apos;s storage capacity is far superior to pressurized tanks, SCMP explains. The material is also of interest to scientists in the field of spacecraft propulsion. 
Naturally, scientists recognized that densely-packed hydrogen offers extraordinary explosive potential, and set out to build explosive devices to measure the destructive force. China&apos;s pioneering evaluation started small, with a test bomb weighing just 4.4 pounds (2kg). The resulting fireball impressed researchers, producing heat exceeding 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 Celsius). More importantly, the fireball lasted more than two seconds, which is 15 times longer than a comparably-scaled TNT explosion. No nuclear materials were involved.

The test bomb was produced by the the 705 Research Institute, a subsidiary operation of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). Among its many scientific endeavors, the 705 Research Institute is a leading force in China&apos;s development of underwater weapon systems. However, the bomb test was conducted on land and SCMP&apos;s summary of the paper didn&apos;t address any naval-kinetic-warfare implications; however, magnesium hydride is being eyed for possible use in submarine fuel cells. The peer-reviewed paper on the innovative bomb appeared in the Chinese-language Journal of Projectiles, Rockets, Missiles and Guidance. 
“Hydrogen gas explosions ignite with minimal ignition energy, have a broad explosion range, and unleash flames that race outward rapidly while spreading widely,” the research team in a peer-reviewed paper published by the Chinese-language Journal of Projectiles, Rockets, Missiles and Guidance. “This combination allows precise control over blast intensity, easily achieving uniform destruction of targets across vast areas.” In addition to that use, the 705 Research Institute&apos;s scientists also evaluated the bomb&apos;s potential use in confined attacks on high-value targets.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito filed a strongly worded dissent from the court’s order issued early April 19 that temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting alleged members of the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2893%29_5.jpg?itok=yKo8Ayoc&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2893%29_5.jpg?itok=yKo8Ayoc&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;01f5ecd3-e8f9-4722-997f-da57ab8512e4&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2893%29_5.jpg?itok=yKo8Ayoc&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dissenting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a1007_22p3.pdf&quot;&gt;opinion&lt;/a&gt;, which was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, was posted on the court’s website early on April 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule,&lt;/strong&gt; without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,” Alito wrote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I refused to join the Court’s order because &lt;strong&gt;we had no good reason to think that, under the circumstances, issuing an order at midnight was necessary or appropriate&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Both the Executive and the Judiciary have an obligation to follow the law. The Executive must proceed under the terms of our order in Trump v. J.G.G., and this Court should follow established procedures,” Alito wrote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The justices acted even though “it is not clear the Court had jurisdiction,” or authority to hear the case, he wrote.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The papers before us, while alleging that the applicants were in imminent danger of removal, provided little concrete support for that allegation,” Alito wrote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Trump v. J.G.G., the Supreme Court on April 7 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/supreme-court-grants-trumps-request-to-halt-order-in-deportations-case-5835290&quot;&gt;granted&lt;/a&gt; the president’s request to pause a federal district judge’s orders preventing his administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected members of Tren de Aragua but determined that detainees must be given an opportunity to challenge their removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The unsigned one-page administrative stay &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/041925zr_c18e.pdf&quot;&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; early April 19 to which Alito referred directed the federal government “not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An administrative stay gives the justices more time to consider the emergency request to block the deportations. That order did not provide an explanation of why the court acted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order was issued after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed an emergency request on behalf of two Venezuelan nationals late on April 18, asking the Supreme Court to immediately block their deportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A1007/356063/20250418172902261_2025.04.18%20AARP%20Application.pdf&quot;&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; in A.A.R.P. and W.M.M. v. Trump challenges President Donald Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport illegal immigrants who are alleged or confirmed criminal gang members. A.A.R.P. and W.M.M. are the initials of two of the detained men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ACLU also sought a temporary restraining order from the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, as well as a stay of removal order from the Fifth Circuit, according to the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 14, Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/20/2025-04865/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; Proclamation 10903, in which he officially declared that Tren de Aragua, a designated foreign terrorist organization, “is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group is using mass illegal immigration to the United States to harm U.S. citizens, undermine public safety, and support the goal of the Venezuelan socialist regime with which it is associated to destabilize “democratic nations in the Americas, including the United States,” the proclamation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The president invoked the Alien Enemies Act to authorize the “immediate apprehension, detention, and removal” of members of the group who are Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older and who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application said the ACLU’s clients are challenging the Trump administration’s use of the federal statute to deport them. The clients “are in imminent and ongoing jeopardy of being removed from the United States without notice or an opportunity to be heard, in direct contravention of this Court’s order in Trump v. J.G.G.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Many individuals have already been loaded on to buses, presumably headed to the airport,” and are at risk of being sent to a prison in El Salvador, according to the April 18 application.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On March 15, the Trump administration used the Alien Enemies Act to deport at least 137 Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they are now incarcerated “possibly for the rest of their lives” at the Salvadoran Terrorism Confinement Center, which is “one of the most notorious prisons in the world,” the application said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application alleged that many of those deported since March 15 were not members of Tren de Aragua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Such false accusations are particularly devastating given the present Applicants’ strong claims for relief under our immigration laws,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;the application said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application came one day after U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix of the Northern District of Texas denied the ACLU clients’ request for a temporary restraining order halting removal efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hendrix rejected the ACLU’s claim that its clients were “at imminent risk of summary removal” because the government denied the allegation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late on April 19, Solicitor General D. John Sauer urged the Supreme Court to deny the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“At a minimum, if the Court keeps its administrative stay in place, the government respectfully requests that the Court clarify that it is administratively staying removals only under the [Alien Enemies Act], and that its order does not preclude removal pursuant to any other immigration authorities,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Sauer wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Alito Calls Supreme Court Block Of Venezuelan Gang Deportations &quot;Legally Questionable&quot;

            
Authored by Matthew Vadum via The Epoch Times,
Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito filed a strongly worded dissent from the court’s order issued early April 19 that temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting alleged members of the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua.



The dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, was posted on the court’s website early on April 20.
“In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,” Alito wrote.
“I refused to join the Court’s order because we had no good reason to think that, under the circumstances, issuing an order at midnight was necessary or appropriate.”
“Both the Executive and the Judiciary have an obligation to follow the law. The Executive must proceed under the terms of our order in Trump v. J.G.G., and this Court should follow established procedures,” Alito wrote.
The justices acted even though “it is not clear the Court had jurisdiction,” or authority to hear the case, he wrote.
“The papers before us, while alleging that the applicants were in imminent danger of removal, provided little concrete support for that allegation,” Alito wrote.
In Trump v. J.G.G., the Supreme Court on April 7 granted the president’s request to pause a federal district judge’s orders preventing his administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected members of Tren de Aragua but determined that detainees must be given an opportunity to challenge their removal.
The unsigned one-page administrative stay issued early April 19 to which Alito referred directed the federal government “not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court.”
An administrative stay gives the justices more time to consider the emergency request to block the deportations. That order did not provide an explanation of why the court acted.
The order was issued after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed an emergency request on behalf of two Venezuelan nationals late on April 18, asking the Supreme Court to immediately block their deportation.
The emergency application in A.A.R.P. and W.M.M. v. Trump challenges President Donald Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport illegal immigrants who are alleged or confirmed criminal gang members. A.A.R.P. and W.M.M. are the initials of two of the detained men.
The ACLU also sought a temporary restraining order from the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, as well as a stay of removal order from the Fifth Circuit, according to the application.
On March 14, Trump signed Proclamation 10903, in which he officially declared that Tren de Aragua, a designated foreign terrorist organization, “is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.”
The group is using mass illegal immigration to the United States to harm U.S. citizens, undermine public safety, and support the goal of the Venezuelan socialist regime with which it is associated to destabilize “democratic nations in the Americas, including the United States,” the proclamation said.

“Many individuals have already been loaded on to buses, presumably headed to the airport,” and are at risk of being sent to a prison in El Salvador, according to the April 18 application.
On March 15, the Trump administration used the Alien Enemies Act to deport at least 137 Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they are now incarcerated “possibly for the rest of their lives” at the Salvadoran Terrorism Confinement Center, which is “one of the most notorious prisons in the world,” the application said.
The application alleged that many of those deported since March 15 were not members of Tren de Aragua.
“Such false accusations are particularly devastating given the present Applicants’ strong claims for relief under our immigration laws,” the application said.
The application came one day after U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix of the Northern District of Texas denied the ACLU clients’ request for a temporary restraining order halting removal efforts.
Hendrix rejected the ACLU’s claim that its clients were “at imminent risk of summary removal” because the government denied the allegation.
Late on April 19, Solicitor General D. John Sauer urged the Supreme Court to deny the application.
“At a minimum, if the Court keeps its administrative stay in place, the government respectfully requests that the Court clarify that it is administratively staying removals only under the [Alien Enemies Act], and that its order does not preclude removal pursuant to any other immigration authorities,” Sauer wrote.

&lt;p&gt;Japan may loosen auto safety rules for U.S. imports to address President Trump’s concerns over the low number of American cars sold there, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports. With differing safety standards between the two countries, Tokyo is eyeing crash test regulations as a possible trade concession, &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/Trump-tariffs/Japan-to-put-car-safety-standards-on-table-in-Trump-tariffs-talks&quot;&gt;according to Nikkei&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a White House meeting, Trump criticized Japan’s trade surplus and poor U.S. auto sales. Cabinet-level talks focused on non-tariff barriers, particularly in the auto and agriculture sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, a signatory to a 1958 U.N. pact on unified auto standards, maintains its own certification process, requiring separate approval for American imports—a process that can take months. While the U.S. participates in discussions under the U.N. framework, it uses its own safety rules and lets automakers self-test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/Trump-tariffs/Japan-to-put-car-safety-standards-on-table-in-Trump-tariffs-talks&quot;&gt;report says&lt;/a&gt; that the U.S. Trade Representative recently flagged Japan’s crash test requirements as a non-tariff barrier, citing them as overly burdensome and unfair to U.S. carmakers. These safety standards—especially for frontal and side collisions—have long been a sticking point in trade talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During past Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, Japan agreed to ease some requirements for U.S. imports, such as skipping certain tests like fire retardancy. It also expanded exemptions for low-volume American car sales. However, those TPP concessions faded after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;A Conspiracy Theory That Is Being Pushed By The Left Claims That Something Really Big Is Going To Happen Today&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://endoftheamericandream.com/a-conspiracy-theory-that-is-being-pushed-by-the-left-claims-that-something-really-big-is-going-to-happen-on-april-20th/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authored by Michael Snyder via The End of The American Dream blog,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most people on the right have no idea just how crazed many people on the left have become. &lt;/strong&gt; Right now, a conspiracy theory which claims that President Trump is preparing to declare martial law in the United States is spreading like wildfire on social media. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; According to that conspiracy theory, a report will be submitted to President Trump on April 20th which will recommend that he should invoke the Insurrection Act to help deal with the border crisis.  &lt;strong&gt;That would allow U.S. troops to help secure the border, but many leftists are convinced that President Trump will also use U.S. troops to round up political activists and send them to prisons in El Salvador.&lt;/strong&gt;  I realize that this may sound really bizarre to many of you, but this is what many of them actually believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/Snip20250414_65.jpg?itok=azhsMbu9&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Snip20250414_65.jpg?itok=azhsMbu9&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;bca1c3bc-e651-4994-89d2-80169062b428&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;438&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Snip20250414_65.jpg?itok=azhsMbu9&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early last month, an article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/insurrection-act-president-trump-20201819.php&quot;&gt;that was published by the San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt; got the ball rolling by highlighting&lt;/strong&gt; the fact that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security will soon submit a report to President Trump recommending whether or not to invoke the Insurrection Act…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock is ticking down on a crucial but little-noticed part of President Donald Trump’s first round of executive orders — the one tasking the secretaries of the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to submit a joint report, within 90 days, recommending “whether to invoke the Insurrection Act.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us are now holding our collective breath, knowing that the report and what it contains could put us on the slippery slope toward unchecked presidential power under a man with an affinity for ironfisted dictators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is not exactly an honest characterization of what that executive order says. &lt;/strong&gt; I have reproduced the relevant portion of that particular executive order &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-emergency-at-the-southern-border-of-the-united-states/&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 90 days of the date of this proclamation, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a joint report to the President about the conditions at the southern border of the United States and any recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration wants to use U.S. troops to help secure the border, and that is probably what we are going to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many leftists are absolutely convinced that we are also about to see martial law in this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An article that was authored by an anonymous leftist known as “Aletheisthenes” that was entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@aletheisthenes/on-april-20th-2025-the-united-states-will-cross-the-point-of-no-return-0aecac04cfc3&quot;&gt;“Part 1: On April 20th, 2025, the United States may Cross the Point of No Return”&lt;/a&gt; has created a firestorm of panic among far left radicals. &lt;/strong&gt; According to that article, once President Trump officially invokes the Insurrection Act it will set a “larger plan in motion”…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as his two months in office has already shown, he won’t stop at just a legal opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect an executive order even that same day or the next, officially declaring the Insurrection Act, restricting freedoms in the name of restoring control of the border and perhaps in blue-state cities, and setting the larger plan in motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this won’t be framed as an attack on democracy. It will be packaged as a necessary response to crisis — as authoritarian takeovers always are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once it happens, there’s no going back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be the point of no return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aletheisthenes believes that the plan to implement martial law in this nation will unfold &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@aletheisthenes/on-april-20th-2025-the-united-states-will-cross-the-point-of-no-return-0aecac04cfc3&quot;&gt;in eight stages&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. “Resist!” Demonstrations Grow — Just As Planned&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. The False Flag Crisis: Turning Protest into “Terror”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Trump Declares Expanded Martial Law — And Calls for Militia to assist the police and Military&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Mass Arrests of Opposition Leaders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Military &amp; National Guard Take Over Major Cities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Press Censorship &amp; Total Media Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. Borders Close &amp; Dissidents Are Trapped Inside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Elections Are “Postponed” Indefinitely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Needless to say, this is not what Trump intends to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do believe that anti-Trump protests funded by very deep pockets on the left will continue to grow, and every time President Trump does something to try to keep those protests under control it will fuel their delusions even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aletheisthenes followed up his original article with another very popular article in which he claimed that Trump’s ultimate goal is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@aletheisthenes/if-the-shit-actually-hits-the-fan-b491462c6057&quot;&gt;“fully overthrow the United States government”&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On or slightly after April 20th, 2025, &lt;strong&gt;Trump will most likely sign an executive order invoking the Insurrection Act.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excuse will be to secure the border and deport violent gang member illegal aliens, and possibly bring order to out-of-control cities, but it will actually be the first step to eventually fully declare martial law across the United States, and suspend civil liberties, and the US Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To most it will come &lt;strong&gt;without warning&lt;/strong&gt;. The press might not even report on it until the last minute. When it happens, expect &lt;strong&gt;confusion, misinformation, and panic&lt;/strong&gt;. Many will be caught off guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(But &lt;strong&gt;a few of us won’t be, &lt;/strong&gt;at least not entirely — because we saw this coming.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ultimate purpose is to eventually fully overthrow the United States government, put Trump, his billionaire co-conspirators, and people who share the values of his very fuzzy reactionary political coalition fully and permanently in control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But this is what they actually believe, and they are going to act accordingly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative that President Trump is some sort of a dictator will motivate leftists to show up at protests, and when some of those protests inevitably turn violent and authorities are forced to respond it will cause even more easily fooled people to embrace that narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see what leftists are already saying on social media.  Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pcmzn3lb3n6vha766ajfsee6/post/3lmkhhu2bwc2w&quot;&gt;just one example&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a veteran, if martial law is declared in the U.S., it means the Constitution is suspended. Civilian government Gone. Freedom of speech, assembly, the press? Gone. Curfews. Checkpoints. Arrest without warrants. No due process. I believe the military would stand with the people &amp; Constitution”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are openly talking about civil conflict, and this has been going on for months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But most people on the right have no idea this is happening.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conspiracy theory that I have discussed in this article has gained so much traction that Snopes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/09/trump-martial-law-insurrection-act/&quot;&gt;was even forced to address it&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reader emailed Snopes, “I am seeing many posts on Facebook that on April 20, Trump will declare martial law.” Another person referenced an executive order issued on Jan. 20, the first day of Trump’s second term, and asked, “I have seen a variety of posts suggesting that an early executive order signed by the president has set the stage for the imposition of martial law, and that this will be triggered by a report on the state of the border that will be released on April 20. Any truth here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, Snopes considers this conspiracy theory to be more of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/09/trump-martial-law-insurrection-act/&quot;&gt;“a prediction than a provable claim”&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing on April 9, this rumor existed more as a prediction than a provable claim. Searches of the websites for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/XOOgA&quot;&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/xSKMS&quot;&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/CwnaJ&quot;&gt;White&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/pNkbn&quot;&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; yielded no announcements, statements or demonstrable evidence that might help to shed light on the unproven matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually think that there are many on the left that would love to see President Trump declare martial law, because they are convinced that would give them justification for what they have been intending to do all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have never been more divided as a society than we are right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil disorder on a scale that we have never seen before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM6S4V9V&quot;&gt;is coming&lt;/a&gt;, but even after all of the political violence that we have already witnessed in recent weeks a lot of people still don’t want to believe it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sticking our heads in the sand won’t make the threat go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our society is reaching a boiling point, and it won’t be too long before events spiral completely out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>A Conspiracy Theory That Is Being Pushed By The Left Claims That Something Really Big Is Going To Happen Today

            
Authored by Michael Snyder via The End of The American Dream blog,
Most people on the right have no idea just how crazed many people on the left have become.  Right now, a conspiracy theory which claims that President Trump is preparing to declare martial law in the United States is spreading like wildfire on social media. 
 According to that conspiracy theory, a report will be submitted to President Trump on April 20th which will recommend that he should invoke the Insurrection Act to help deal with the border crisis.  That would allow U.S. troops to help secure the border, but many leftists are convinced that President Trump will also use U.S. troops to round up political activists and send them to prisons in El Salvador.  I realize that this may sound really bizarre to many of you, but this is what many of them actually believe.

3. Trump Declares Expanded Martial Law — And Calls for Militia to assist the police and Military
4. Mass Arrests of Opposition Leaders
5. Military &amp; National Guard Take Over Major Cities
6. Press Censorship &amp; Total Media Control
7. Borders Close &amp; Dissidents Are Trapped Inside
8. Elections Are “Postponed” Indefinitely
Needless to say, this is not what Trump intends to do.
But I do believe that anti-Trump protests funded by very deep pockets on the left will continue to grow, and every time President Trump does something to try to keep those protests under control it will fuel their delusions even more.
Aletheisthenes followed up his original article with another very popular article in which he claimed that Trump’s ultimate goal is to “fully overthrow the United States government”…
On or slightly after April 20th, 2025, Trump will most likely sign an executive order invoking the Insurrection Act.
The excuse will be to secure the border and deport violent gang member illegal aliens, and possibly bring order to out-of-control cities, but it will actually be the first step to eventually fully declare martial law across the United States, and suspend civil liberties, and the US Constitution.
To most it will come without warning. The press might not even report on it until the last minute. When it happens, expect confusion, misinformation, and panic. Many will be caught off guard.
(But a few of us won’t be, at least not entirely — because we saw this coming.)
The ultimate purpose is to eventually fully overthrow the United States government, put Trump, his billionaire co-conspirators, and people who share the values of his very fuzzy reactionary political coalition fully and permanently in control.
This is nuts.
But this is what they actually believe, and they are going to act accordingly.
The narrative that President Trump is some sort of a dictator will motivate leftists to show up at protests, and when some of those protests inevitably turn violent and authorities are forced to respond it will cause even more easily fooled people to embrace that narrative.
You should see what leftists are already saying on social media.  Here is just one example…
“As a veteran, if martial law is declared in the U.S., it means the Constitution is suspended. Civilian government Gone. Freedom of speech, assembly, the press? Gone. Curfews. Checkpoints. Arrest without warrants. No due process. I believe the military would stand with the people &amp; Constitution”
They are openly talking about civil conflict, and this has been going on for months.
But most people on the right have no idea this is happening.
The conspiracy theory that I have discussed in this article has gained so much traction that Snopes was even forced to address it…
One reader emailed Snopes, “I am seeing many posts on Facebook that on April 20, Trump will declare martial law.” Another person referenced an executive order issued on Jan. 20, the first day of Trump’s second term, and asked, “I have seen a variety of posts suggesting that an early executive order signed by the president has set the stage for the imposition of martial law, and that this will be triggered by a report on the state of the border that will be released on April 20. Any truth here?”
At this point, Snopes considers this conspiracy theory to be more of “a prediction than a provable claim”…
As of this writing on April 9, this rumor existed more as a prediction than a provable claim. Searches of the websites for the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and the White House yielded no announcements, statements or demonstrable evidence that might help to shed light on the unproven matter.
I actually think that there are many on the left that would love to see President Trump declare martial law, because they are convinced that would give them justification for what they have been intending to do all along.
We have never been more divided as a society than we are right now.
Civil disorder on a scale that we have never seen before is coming, but even after all of the political violence that we have already witnessed in recent weeks a lot of people still don’t want to believe it.
But sticking our heads in the sand won’t make the threat go away.
Our society is reaching a boiling point, and it won’t be too long before events spiral completely out of control.

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/fda-removing-pharmaceutical-representatives-from-advisory-panels-5843944?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&amp;src_src=partner&amp;src_cmp=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis ours),&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is removing pharmaceutical company representatives from advisory committees in a bid to limit industry influence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%281496%29_0.jpg?itok=nQWJCVOv&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%281496%29_0.jpg?itok=nQWJCVOv&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;figure role=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;215e11be-5623-4635-b329-cb2d32303858&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%281496%29_0.jpg?itok=nQWJCVOv&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Marty Makary, then the nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration, testifies during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 6, 2025. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marty Makary, the FDA’s new commissioner, issued a directive that eliminates the role of pharmaceutical representative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Industry employees are welcome to attend FDA advisory committee meetings, along with the rest of the American public, but having industry employees serve as official members of FDA advisory committee members represents a cozy relationship that is concerning to many Americans,&lt;/strong&gt;” Makary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-commissioner-makary-announces-new-policy-individuals-serving-fda-advisory-committees&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement on April 17. “In fact, the FDA has a history of being influenced unduly by corporate interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA has 32 different advisory committees, including panels that advise the agency on vaccines, food, and medical devices. Members are primarily a mix of federal employees and experts who do not work for industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But each FDA committee has an industry representative and an alternate industry representative. The Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, for instance, had a Pfizer officer and a Dynavax officer listed on the roster for its most recent meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry representatives do not vote on what advice to convey to the FDA, but “offer perspective of a pharmaceutical company,” Kim Witczak, who has served on several FDA advisory committees, told The Epoch Times in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes they will say something that could influence or sway the discussion. I always wondered why they were on the committee&lt;/strong&gt;,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA did not release Makary’s directive but described it as limiting people employed at companies regulated by the FDA, such as pharmaceutical firms, from serving as members of FDA advisory committees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today’s action will not preclude employees of regulated companies from attending or presenting their views at advisory committee meetings or serving as representative members of the committee when required by statute,” the agency stated. “Also, exceptions can be made in rare circumstances (i.e., when the scientific expertise in an area is only available from an employee of an FDA-regulated company) provided that the official strictly complies with the applicable ethics requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Makary said the directive was issued to make sure scientific evaluation of new products is independent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Public trust in the healthcare-industrial complex is at an all-time low. We need to restore impeccable integrity to the process and avoid potential conflicts of interest,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PhRMA, a trade group for the pharmaceutical industry, did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Hamas Video Shows Israeli Hostage Urging Trump To Gain His Release&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday the armed wing of Hamas, known as the Qassam Brigades, issued a &apos;proof of life&apos; video showing Israeli hostage Elkana Buhbut &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/israeli-hostage-trump/2025/04/19/id/1207501/&quot;&gt;speaking to his US national wife&lt;/a&gt; in a phone call, requesting that President Donald Trump release hostages from Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elkana&apos;s family released a statement alongside the video: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;For 535 days Elkana has been trapped in an ongoing hell,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; the family said. &quot;The video reveals his dire condition – he has lost substantial weight from prolonged starvation, suffers from skin and respiratory problems in addition to his asthma, and has been deprived of daylight for nearly a year and a half.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/elkana.jpg?itok=e4KV7BuZ&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/elkana.jpg?itok=e4KV7BuZ&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ed107c47-8d2c-4185-8835-9c2b4f4c7672&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/elkana.jpg?itok=e4KV7BuZ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This footage provides further evidence that Elkana must be returned home to his family, to his wife Rivka and son Re&apos;em David immediately,&quot; the statement read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Elkana is desperately calling for help, begging not to be forgotten in these hellish tunnels. &lt;strong&gt;We urgently appeal to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump&lt;/strong&gt; – please consider this as if he were your own son, the father of your grandchild, who is waiting to see daylight, hearing IDF bombs overhead while living in constant fear for his life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump has lately appeared to back Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&apos;s pledge to unleash &quot;hell&quot; in Gaza and pursue &quot;complete victory&quot; against Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this plan has outraged families of the remaining captives, who are demanding that the broken ceasefire be renewed at least until they can get their loved ones back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t the first time that Buhbut has been featured in a Hamas propaganda video. Some pundits accused Hamas of staging a fake phone call for the Buhbut hostage video...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;With the family’s permission: Hamas released a propaganda video of hostage Elkana Bohbot, 36, for the third time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
They forced him to fake a phone call with his family—who he hasn’t spoken to in 550+ days. This is one of the most sick acts of psychological terrorism I’ve seen. We… &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/XZp0YngTDU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/XZp0YngTDU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month Hamas &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/hamas-ready-free-all-hostages-once-permanent-truce&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it is ready to release all remaining hostages if a permanent ceasefire is reached. At the same time, Palestinian officials have asserted that the group will &lt;strong&gt;&quot;never disarm&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; until a Palestinian state is created. Israel fears the terror group would just rise up again and resume rocket launches on its territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point there seems little hope for a renewed truce, as Israel has fully committed to a renewed air and ground campaign, and has kept Rafah and other cities surrounded and under military occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&quot;This footage provides further evidence that Elkana must be returned home to his family, to his wife Rivka and son Re&apos;em David immediately,&quot; the statement read. 
&quot;Elkana is desperately calling for help, begging not to be forgotten in these hellish tunnels. We urgently appeal to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump – please consider this as if he were your own son, the father of your grandchild, who is waiting to see daylight, hearing IDF bombs overhead while living in constant fear for his life.&quot;
Trump has lately appeared to back Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&apos;s pledge to unleash &quot;hell&quot; in Gaza and pursue &quot;complete victory&quot; against Hamas.
But this plan has outraged families of the remaining captives, who are demanding that the broken ceasefire be renewed at least until they can get their loved ones back.
This isn&apos;t the first time that Buhbut has been featured in a Hamas propaganda video. Some pundits accused Hamas of staging a fake phone call for the Buhbut hostage video...
With the family’s permission: Hamas released a propaganda video of hostage Elkana Bohbot, 36, for the third time.

They forced him to fake a phone call with his family—who he hasn’t spoken to in 550+ days. This is one of the most sick acts of psychological terrorism I’ve seen. We… pic.twitter.com/XZp0YngTDU

Earlier this month Hamas said it is ready to release all remaining hostages if a permanent ceasefire is reached. At the same time, Palestinian officials have asserted that the group will &quot;never disarm&quot; until a Palestinian state is created. Israel fears the terror group would just rise up again and resume rocket launches on its territory.
At this point there seems little hope for a renewed truce, as Israel has fully committed to a renewed air and ground campaign, and has kept Rafah and other cities surrounded and under military occupation.

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;Switching From The Tariff Phase To The Deal Phase&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Peter Tchir of Academy Securities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dealpalooza&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a relatively quiet week on the tariff front. Last Friday night we had more tariff exemptions, followed by promises (or threats) of sectoral tariffs. &lt;strong&gt;But since then, the chatter has become all about the deals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, there is the talk about firing Fed Chair Powell, but away from that, &lt;strong&gt;on the economic front, we seemed to have switched from the tariff phase to the deal phase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not think firing Powell would be a good thing over time. It would be a step towards reducing (or eliminating) the Fed’s independence. I don’t always agree with their policy. I do think it is weird that they feel the need to have less dissent than the politburo on their votes. But I think the appearance (and largely reality) of Fed independence helps the dollar and the Treasury market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But markets are more likely to move on “deals” than anything else in the coming days and weeks &lt;/strong&gt;(assuming some new, major topic doesn’t get introduced into the conversation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Deal Messaging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The administration is touting deals. Progress. More deals&lt;/strong&gt;. However, the administration seems to have backed off from stating that countries are begging for deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. messaging is clear (and less aggressive than before):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Countries are calling. Countries are lined up.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We will get deals. Good deals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;messaging from the rest of the world &lt;/strong&gt;is far from clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Japan specifically met on trade and provided almost no detail. Neither side seems to have leaked any details.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;China has said very little, if anything, through official channels. Not too surprising as they are “public enemy number 1” but it doesn’t support the administration’s messaging that China is coming for a deal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I’ve spent hours looking for details on the deals, from the U.S. and abroad, and cannot find anything outside of the U.S. Even within the U.S. the messaging seems a bit mixed, though it is still leaning towards rectifying unfair situations and improving trade balances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With little to no information, we have to guess which is an issue, but at least it can help us prepare a plan for how to react to the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What Are Tariffs Meant to Achieve?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first problem in trying to evaluate our trade and tariff policy is trying to understand what tariffs are supposed to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bargaining position.&lt;/strong&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure what we are bargaining for, but this would indicate that tariffs would be temporary.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased sales of Made in the U.S.A.&lt;/strong&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imported goods would rise in cost relative to domestic goods, which should increase domestic sales. That requires tariffs to stay in place.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;If tariffs against the U.S. are reduced or eliminated, then American made goods would be less expensive to import. &lt;strong&gt;This would likely occur only if the tariffs were temporary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A revenue source&lt;/strong&gt;. Tariffs would have to remain in place for them to generate money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the objectives that have been presented by senior people in the administration &lt;strong&gt;cannot co-exist&lt;/strong&gt;. Deciphering which reasons are most important has been incredibly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question that comes to mind is &lt;strong&gt;how big of an impact will tariffs have on the ability to increase sales of Made in America products?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If tariffs stay in place&lt;/strong&gt;, will the price increase on imports be enough to drive Made in America sales? Will it be enough to invest in factories, etc., to build more to sell?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If other countries abandon tariffs&lt;/strong&gt;, how much will Made in America sales increase? Very difficult to tell as non-tariff barriers can be as impactful or more impactful than tariffs. Also, it is unclear how much is a &lt;strong&gt;function of demand for American products, &lt;/strong&gt;as opposed to tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that part of the equation as clear as mud, let’s move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Missing in Trade Math&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we can all safely agree that &lt;strong&gt;the administration is focused on trade deficits&lt;/strong&gt;. We can all argue about a lot of things, but this much is clear. It is consistent with Trump 1.0 as well. Heck, it is consistent with things President Trump said long before he became president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two things that I think are insane to be left out of the trade conversation, yet they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The trade balance of services.&lt;/strong&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why aren’t services included in our overall analysis of trade with other countries? &lt;strong&gt;The U.S. currently has service surpluses with most countries. &lt;/strong&gt;Maybe it is more difficult to imagine “cloud computing” being manufactured, but it is the sort of thing that the U.S. is exporting – very effectively. Since we all know that the U.S. has become a service economy (for better or worse), it seems insane not to include this number as part of any overall trade analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profitability of trade.&lt;/strong&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I assume some things are more profitable than others. If we export things with a higher profit margin than the profit margin made on what we import, basic trade balances overstate the issue. If I buy $200 of stuff from you, that you make 10% on, but sell to you $100 of stuff we make 20% on, are we more balanced than a 2:1 import vs. export ratio would indicate? I think somewhere in the conversation there should be a consideration about profitability, but nowhere does that seem to show up. Services that we export are likely very high profit margin.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of other things “irk” me. Not insane, but curious at least, why they don’t come up more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raw materials and intermediate goods, versus finished products&lt;/strong&gt;. I haven’t spent much time on this, but it seems to be that knowing more details about this type of trade would help us make better decisions. Are all trade balances equally bad?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens to goods manufactured for an American company that don’t come to America&lt;/strong&gt;? I presume (for many global companies) that only a portion of the goods they make come back to the U.S. Some are probably sold in China. I assume, that for many, if you want to sell into Asia, you don’t bring them back to the U.S. to sell into Asia. So, an American company that builds something overseas and then doesn’t import it helps that American company. Though conversely, that also means that even more things could be made here because the trade deficit is even worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how we got to where we are on trade balances, but I suspect a more detailed discussion and analysis would reduce the perceived problem, rather than amplifying it. But that is not where we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tariff Rollout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before thinking about what deals might occur, we do need to look at the tariff rollout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China, Canada, and Mexico&lt;/strong&gt;. Initial wave of tariffs were given a “Fentanyl Reprieve” for Canada and Mexico. Despite what looked like some efforts on that front (especially from Mexico) the tariffs went ahead as the fentanyl reprieve was waived. Maybe the reprieve can come back again. The initial reprieve was positive regarding how the U.S. might address tariffs, but that went to the wayside and hinted at some level of confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steel and Aluminum. &lt;/strong&gt;Separate from other tariffs and were implemented globally. Demonstrated the administration was serious about tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backing off on USMCA Compliant Goods. &lt;/strong&gt;First autos and then all USMCA compliant goods were exempted from the Canada/Mexico tariffs. Seems like this could have been anticipated, which likely affects how countries come to the negotiating table.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Liberation Day tariffs. &lt;/strong&gt;Literally instant disbelief over the numbers presented. Reciprocal tariffs were anything but reciprocal. To the rest of the world, this looked like the U.S. had gone “off the deep end” on tariffs. (Even to many in the states).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Liberation Day tariffs went into effect. &lt;/strong&gt;More confusion for markets.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;90-Day Reprieve and “Reciprocal” Tariffs of “only” 10%. &lt;/strong&gt;What an amazing rally in the stock market. Suddenly 90 days to negotiate (which seems like it would have made sense from day 1). Also, while 10% is at the high side of overall tariffs between countries, it was at least in the ballpark. China was not given a break. It seemed like maybe the administration was reading the T-Reports, and this had pulled us back to the “somewhat reasonable” zone and clearly indicated that China was the main priority.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some further exemptions on products, primarily tech. &lt;/strong&gt;Another thing that made sense, though this looked like the U.S. was once again backing down on something they could have foreseen as an issue.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then statements about how National Security and sectoral tariffs would pick up the slack here&lt;/strong&gt;. Though it has been quiet since then.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further restrictions on what chips can be sold to China&lt;/strong&gt;. Hit some U.S. stocks, but further enforced the view that China is public enemy number 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the tariffs have been rolled out and have evolved, I think is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Foreign Mindset Coming Into Negotiations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As countries come to the negotiating table, I think this is a reasonable assessment of their state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some confusion over why they were targeted &lt;/strong&gt;and the amount they were targeted with.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some trepidation about needing the U.S. market&lt;/strong&gt;, but also about how much they can depend on any deal going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least somewhat encouraged by what they may see as a series of miscalculations &lt;/strong&gt;where the administration had to back down because of damage done to our markets or economy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art of the Deal is quite simple and easily understood&lt;/strong&gt;. During Trump 1.0, few seemed to understand that. This time, many, particularly Xi, seem to understand that. Presumably, Trump knows that others know the art of the deal and they are adapting. Though, given how events have unfolded, I am not sure that the U.S. policy wasn’t dependent on getting the same reactions from world leaders as they received under Trump 1.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My view is that countries are coming in concerned about the economic impact on their country, but with the sense that mistakes have been made, and there is some lack of trust&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. deals are going to be viewed as a stopgap solution, giving them time to figure out longer-term solutions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Deals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we get to the main point. &lt;strong&gt;Are we going to get “rip your face off” rallies on the back of deals? &lt;/strong&gt;Or will deals or the lack of deals drag markets (and the economy) lower?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Face-saving deal. &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s for a moment assume the administration has had a “rethink” on tariff and trade policy. That they are hearing from so many businesses that the tariff policy as enacted is not helpful. That bringing manufacturing jobs back to America will take years (and would be better accomplished by focusing on domestic policy first, to get the ball rolling). The administration has clearly backed off, so, what would a face-saving deal look like?

	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced tariffs on both sides. &lt;/strong&gt;I’m 98% convinced this could have been achieved without taking many of the steps that have hurt the administration. The other countries, at this stage, are far more likely to understand both the tariff and non-tariff barriers they have in place and where to cave and where not to cave to get the best deal for themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commitments to buy American made goods &lt;/strong&gt;– with a focus on defense and agriculture. No real teeth to enforce compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some commitment to not allowing China to use them to change “country of origin” designations&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s a bit tricky, but not a big deal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My estimate for this type of deal being offered by the U.S. to most countries has jumped from about 20% likely to 70% likely &lt;/strong&gt;(given recent news flow and actions around tariffs).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The administration can claim a win, and anyone trying to point out that these results could have been achieved without damaging the U.S. reputation, will be shouted down in social media. The end state will be a similar economy to what we had before. Tariffs were only a portion of the problem, and a minor one at that. Countries won’t increase their actual purchases of U.S. goods for long. They will take the lull to figure out ways to be less dependent on the U.S. &lt;strong&gt;So, markets may rally on the first deal headline or two, but fade as markets will establish that the U.S. economy and U.S. corporations are in a worse spot after these deals than before this whole thing started.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real Trade Balance Deals. &lt;/strong&gt;If the side that has advocated for bringing production home wins, then the U.S. will need deals like this:
	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commitment to buy American made goods, with hard figures and punishments for failing to comply&lt;/strong&gt;. A real effort to ramp up sales of American made goods. Countries commit to buying from America and face punishment (presumably high tariffs) for failing to comply. This might be difficult for many countries to agree to.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restrictions on business with China. &lt;/strong&gt;At the very least, countries will be forced to acknowledge that China can not use them as a conduit to change country of origination. The U.S. may try to get other countries to tariff China (which would make U.S. imports look cheap relative to China). Some willingness to combat China’s worst offenses is likely palatable, but countries will be careful about being too aggressive against China, given China’s size, and in some cases, its proximity. Also, given the erratic nature of U.S. trade policy since the inauguration, countries have to be more hesitant to be perceived as anti-China than before the policies were launched.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariffs as a mix of revenue, punishment, and wins. &lt;/strong&gt;Tariffs drop in importance if the true aim is to get trade balances in line.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It would be nice if the two things that I think are missing from the tariff math are incorporated &lt;/strong&gt;into the administration’s view, as the starting point would be much closer than it is currently being viewed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s assume this approach is now only used 30% of the time. &lt;/strong&gt;I think this approach has a very low success rate. Countries, for a variety of reasons, are likely to resist this. As time goes on, if we don’t get deals, the market will sense that the U.S. has over-reached and will have to price in more economic problems and lower corporate profits. If the U.S. gets deals of this nature, it would be a big and actual win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Path of Negotiations and Deals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My base case is that the U.S. likely started down the “&lt;strong&gt;Real Trade Balance Deals&lt;/strong&gt;” path and that is why we are hearing so little from other countries. They are potentially left confused or even flabbergasted by U.S. demands and are not in a rush to sign that type of deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe some countries cave and sign that type of deal, bringing more countries to that type of deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we go weeks without deals, or worse, leaks that countries are far apart, look for the negotiating strategy to shift to “&lt;strong&gt;Face Saving Deals&lt;/strong&gt;” (if it hasn’t already).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong on how I read the “cards” at the table, but that is my best estimate of who is holding what. I think the biggest risk for markets and the economy, is that one side thinks their cards are far better than they are (and from what I’ve seen so far, that risk seems to be more likely on the American side). That would mean the problems in the global economy would mount and the risk of a deep recession would grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Damage to the American Brand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the entire world lets bygones be bygones, we can get back to roughly where we were before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don’t see that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think there will be an extended period where American stocks, bonds, and products suffer from the geopolitical and economic actions taken.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to be wrong here, but I don’t think I am. Especially since even if deals are signed, the news flow, economically, geopolitically, and domestically will certainly highlight divisiveness that doesn’t help heal any wounds that have been created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the volatility and “beta” to any given headline has been reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this is a path back to where we all thought we were headed – growth fueled by business-friendly strategies. &lt;/strong&gt;Taking actions to spur the development of domestic industries, with an emphasis on issues linked to National Security. The extraction and PROCESSING of commodities, especially those that are energy-related, or crucial to future tech. Chips. A more domestic-focused policy can achieve the goals over time, and have a narrower range of outcomes (that are more predictable than trying to rebalance global trade relationships, that took years to form, in a matter of months).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pivot is required, and we might get it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be pleasantly surprised to see some very strong trade deals announced, but my base case is that we realize that this approach isn’t working, and we wind up getting some face-saving deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The economy is slowing&lt;/strong&gt;, and I think that will become more evident in the coming weeks (unless I’m surprised on the “big trade deal” front).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S., as an investment choice, a tourist destination, or a brand more broadly, is going to act to slow the economy and markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should be good for rates, but all the hope about deficit reduction seems to be diminishing. Much of what I think would be required to make a pivot successful will involve spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that keeps bonds in a range (maybe a wide range of 4.1% to 4.5% on 10s) but a range, nonetheless. At the moment, the risk of breaking out of this range is to the higher yield side. I see more headline risk to bonds than optimism, especially on the deficit side of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equities will suffer, in dribs and drabs, if the U.S. doesn’t back down on what we hope to achieve in trade negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, it comes down to undoing a lot on the trade front and pivoting sharply to doing what is in primarily U.S. control.&lt;br /&gt;
Good luck and hopefully the shelf life of this thought process is more than a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate at which announcements shaping the geopolitical environment, the economic environment, and the investing landscape is staggering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you have been able to use the long weekend to regroup and get ready for more! And hopefully it is Dealpalooza time – we could all use that!&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Switching From The Tariff Phase To The Deal Phase

            
By Peter Tchir of Academy Securities
Dealpalooza
It was a relatively quiet week on the tariff front. Last Friday night we had more tariff exemptions, followed by promises (or threats) of sectoral tariffs. But since then, the chatter has become all about the deals.
Ok, there is the talk about firing Fed Chair Powell, but away from that, on the economic front, we seemed to have switched from the tariff phase to the deal phase.
I do not think firing Powell would be a good thing over time. It would be a step towards reducing (or eliminating) the Fed’s independence. I don’t always agree with their policy. I do think it is weird that they feel the need to have less dissent than the politburo on their votes. But I think the appearance (and largely reality) of Fed independence helps the dollar and the Treasury market.
But markets are more likely to move on “deals” than anything else in the coming days and weeks (assuming some new, major topic doesn’t get introduced into the conversation).
Deal Messaging
The administration is touting deals. Progress. More deals. However, the administration seems to have backed off from stating that countries are begging for deals.
The U.S. messaging is clear (and less aggressive than before):
Countries are calling. Countries are lined up.
We will get deals. Good deals.
The messaging from the rest of the world is far from clear:
Japan specifically met on trade and provided almost no detail. Neither side seems to have leaked any details.
China has said very little, if anything, through official channels. Not too surprising as they are “public enemy number 1” but it doesn’t support the administration’s messaging that China is coming for a deal.
I’ve spent hours looking for details on the deals, from the U.S. and abroad, and cannot find anything outside of the U.S. Even within the U.S. the messaging seems a bit mixed, though it is still leaning towards rectifying unfair situations and improving trade balances.
With little to no information, we have to guess which is an issue, but at least it can help us prepare a plan for how to react to the headlines.
What Are Tariffs Meant to Achieve?
The first problem in trying to evaluate our trade and tariff policy is trying to understand what tariffs are supposed to achieve.
A bargaining position.

	
I’m not sure what we are bargaining for, but this would indicate that tariffs would be temporary.

	
Increased sales of Made in the U.S.A.
	
Imported goods would rise in cost relative to domestic goods, which should increase domestic sales. That requires tariffs to stay in place.
If tariffs against the U.S. are reduced or eliminated, then American made goods would be less expensive to import. This would likely occur only if the tariffs were temporary.

	
A revenue source. Tariffs would have to remain in place for them to generate money.
Some of the objectives that have been presented by senior people in the administration cannot co-exist. Deciphering which reasons are most important has been incredibly difficult.
One question that comes to mind is how big of an impact will tariffs have on the ability to increase sales of Made in America products?
If tariffs stay in place, will the price increase on imports be enough to drive Made in America sales? Will it be enough to invest in factories, etc., to build more to sell?
If other countries abandon tariffs, how much will Made in America sales increase? Very difficult to tell as non-tariff barriers can be as impactful or more impactful than tariffs. Also, it is unclear how much is a function of demand for American products, as opposed to tariffs.
With that part of the equation as clear as mud, let’s move on.
What is Missing in Trade Math
I think we can all safely agree that the administration is focused on trade deficits. We can all argue about a lot of things, but this much is clear. It is consistent with Trump 1.0 as well. Heck, it is consistent with things President Trump said long before he became president.
There are two things that I think are insane to be left out of the trade conversation, yet they are.
The trade balance of services.

	
Why aren’t services included in our overall analysis of trade with other countries? The U.S. currently has service surpluses with most countries. Maybe it is more difficult to imagine “cloud computing” being manufactured, but it is the sort of thing that the U.S. is exporting – very effectively. Since we all know that the U.S. has become a service economy (for better or worse), it seems insane not to include this number as part of any overall trade analysis.

	
Profitability of trade.
	
I assume some things are more profitable than others. If we export things with a higher profit margin than the profit margin made on what we import, basic trade balances overstate the issue. If I buy $200 of stuff from you, that you make 10% on, but sell to you $100 of stuff we make 20% on, are we more balanced than a 2:1 import vs. export ratio would indicate? I think somewhere in the conversation there should be a consideration about profitability, but nowhere does that seem to show up. Services that we export are likely very high profit margin.


A couple of other things “irk” me. Not insane, but curious at least, why they don’t come up more.
Raw materials and intermediate goods, versus finished products. I haven’t spent much time on this, but it seems to be that knowing more details about this type of trade would help us make better decisions. Are all trade balances equally bad?
What happens to goods manufactured for an American company that don’t come to America? I presume (for many global companies) that only a portion of the goods they make come back to the U.S. Some are probably sold in China. I assume, that for many, if you want to sell into Asia, you don’t bring them back to the U.S. to sell into Asia. So, an American company that builds something overseas and then doesn’t import it helps that American company. Though conversely, that also means that even more things could be made here because the trade deficit is even worse.
I’m not sure how we got to where we are on trade balances, but I suspect a more detailed discussion and analysis would reduce the perceived problem, rather than amplifying it. But that is not where we are.
The Tariff Rollout
Before thinking about what deals might occur, we do need to look at the tariff rollout.
China, Canada, and Mexico. Initial wave of tariffs were given a “Fentanyl Reprieve” for Canada and Mexico. Despite what looked like some efforts on that front (especially from Mexico) the tariffs went ahead as the fentanyl reprieve was waived. Maybe the reprieve can come back again. The initial reprieve was positive regarding how the U.S. might address tariffs, but that went to the wayside and hinted at some level of confusion.
Steel and Aluminum. Separate from other tariffs and were implemented globally. Demonstrated the administration was serious about tariffs.
Backing off on USMCA Compliant Goods. First autos and then all USMCA compliant goods were exempted from the Canada/Mexico tariffs. Seems like this could have been anticipated, which likely affects how countries come to the negotiating table.
The Liberation Day tariffs. Literally instant disbelief over the numbers presented. Reciprocal tariffs were anything but reciprocal. To the rest of the world, this looked like the U.S. had gone “off the deep end” on tariffs. (Even to many in the states).
The Liberation Day tariffs went into effect. More confusion for markets.
90-Day Reprieve and “Reciprocal” Tariffs of “only” 10%. What an amazing rally in the stock market. Suddenly 90 days to negotiate (which seems like it would have made sense from day 1). Also, while 10% is at the high side of overall tariffs between countries, it was at least in the ballpark. China was not given a break. It seemed like maybe the administration was reading the T-Reports, and this had pulled us back to the “somewhat reasonable” zone and clearly indicated that China was the main priority.
Some further exemptions on products, primarily tech. Another thing that made sense, though this looked like the U.S. was once again backing down on something they could have foreseen as an issue.
Then statements about how National Security and sectoral tariffs would pick up the slack here. Though it has been quiet since then.
Further restrictions on what chips can be sold to China. Hit some U.S. stocks, but further enforced the view that China is public enemy number 1.
How the tariffs have been rolled out and have evolved, I think is important.
The Foreign Mindset Coming Into Negotiations
As countries come to the negotiating table, I think this is a reasonable assessment of their state of mind.
Some confusion over why they were targeted and the amount they were targeted with.
Some trepidation about needing the U.S. market, but also about how much they can depend on any deal going forward.
At least somewhat encouraged by what they may see as a series of miscalculations where the administration had to back down because of damage done to our markets or economy.
The Art of the Deal is quite simple and easily understood. During Trump 1.0, few seemed to understand that. This time, many, particularly Xi, seem to understand that. Presumably, Trump knows that others know the art of the deal and they are adapting. Though, given how events have unfolded, I am not sure that the U.S. policy wasn’t dependent on getting the same reactions from world leaders as they received under Trump 1.0.
My view is that countries are coming in concerned about the economic impact on their country, but with the sense that mistakes have been made, and there is some lack of trust (i.e. deals are going to be viewed as a stopgap solution, giving them time to figure out longer-term solutions).
The Deals
Finally, we get to the main point. Are we going to get “rip your face off” rallies on the back of deals? Or will deals or the lack of deals drag markets (and the economy) lower?
Face-saving deal. Let’s for a moment assume the administration has had a “rethink” on tariff and trade policy. That they are hearing from so many businesses that the tariff policy as enacted is not helpful. That bringing manufacturing jobs back to America will take years (and would be better accomplished by focusing on domestic policy first, to get the ball rolling). The administration has clearly backed off, so, what would a face-saving deal look like?

	
Reduced tariffs on both sides. I’m 98% convinced this could have been achieved without taking many of the steps that have hurt the administration. The other countries, at this stage, are far more likely to understand both the tariff and non-tariff barriers they have in place and where to cave and where not to cave to get the best deal for themselves.
Commitments to buy American made goods – with a focus on defense and agriculture. No real teeth to enforce compliance.
Some commitment to not allowing China to use them to change “country of origin” designations. It’s a bit tricky, but not a big deal.

	
My estimate for this type of deal being offered by the U.S. to most countries has jumped from about 20% likely to 70% likely (given recent news flow and actions around tariffs).
The administration can claim a win, and anyone trying to point out that these results could have been achieved without damaging the U.S. reputation, will be shouted down in social media. The end state will be a similar economy to what we had before. Tariffs were only a portion of the problem, and a minor one at that. Countries won’t increase their actual purchases of U.S. goods for long. They will take the lull to figure out ways to be less dependent on the U.S. So, markets may rally on the first deal headline or two, but fade as markets will establish that the U.S. economy and U.S. corporations are in a worse spot after these deals than before this whole thing started.
Real Trade Balance Deals. If the side that has advocated for bringing production home wins, then the U.S. will need deals like this:
	
Commitment to buy American made goods, with hard figures and punishments for failing to comply. A real effort to ramp up sales of American made goods. Countries commit to buying from America and face punishment (presumably high tariffs) for failing to comply. This might be difficult for many countries to agree to.
Restrictions on business with China. At the very least, countries will be forced to acknowledge that China can not use them as a conduit to change country of origination. The U.S. may try to get other countries to tariff China (which would make U.S. imports look cheap relative to China). Some willingness to combat China’s worst offenses is likely palatable, but countries will be careful about being too aggressive against China, given China’s size, and in some cases, its proximity. Also, given the erratic nature of U.S. trade policy since the inauguration, countries have to be more hesitant to be perceived as anti-China than before the policies were launched.
Tariffs as a mix of revenue, punishment, and wins. Tariffs drop in importance if the true aim is to get trade balances in line.
It would be nice if the two things that I think are missing from the tariff math are incorporated into the administration’s view, as the starting point would be much closer than it is currently being viewed.


Let’s assume this approach is now only used 30% of the time. I think this approach has a very low success rate. Countries, for a variety of reasons, are likely to resist this. As time goes on, if we don’t get deals, the market will sense that the U.S. has over-reached and will have to price in more economic problems and lower corporate profits. If the U.S. gets deals of this nature, it would be a big and actual win.
The Path of Negotiations and Deals
My base case is that the U.S. likely started down the “Real Trade Balance Deals” path and that is why we are hearing so little from other countries. They are potentially left confused or even flabbergasted by U.S. demands and are not in a rush to sign that type of deal.
Maybe some countries cave and sign that type of deal, bringing more countries to that type of deal.
But if we go weeks without deals, or worse, leaks that countries are far apart, look for the negotiating strategy to shift to “Face Saving Deals” (if it hasn’t already).
I could be wrong on how I read the “cards” at the table, but that is my best estimate of who is holding what. I think the biggest risk for markets and the economy, is that one side thinks their cards are far better than they are (and from what I’ve seen so far, that risk seems to be more likely on the American side). That would mean the problems in the global economy would mount and the risk of a deep recession would grow.
Damage to the American Brand
If the entire world lets bygones be bygones, we can get back to roughly where we were before. 
I just don’t see that.
I think there will be an extended period where American stocks, bonds, and products suffer from the geopolitical and economic actions taken.
I would love to be wrong here, but I don’t think I am. Especially since even if deals are signed, the news flow, economically, geopolitically, and domestically will certainly highlight divisiveness that doesn’t help heal any wounds that have been created.
Bottom Line
I think the volatility and “beta” to any given headline has been reduced.
I think this is a path back to where we all thought we were headed – growth fueled by business-friendly strategies. Taking actions to spur the development of domestic industries, with an emphasis on issues linked to National Security. The extraction and PROCESSING of commodities, especially those that are energy-related, or crucial to future tech. Chips. A more domestic-focused policy can achieve the goals over time, and have a narrower range of outcomes (that are more predictable than trying to rebalance global trade relationships, that took years to form, in a matter of months).
A pivot is required, and we might get it.
I would be pleasantly surprised to see some very strong trade deals announced, but my base case is that we realize that this approach isn’t working, and we wind up getting some face-saving deals.
The economy is slowing, and I think that will become more evident in the coming weeks (unless I’m surprised on the “big trade deal” front).
The U.S., as an investment choice, a tourist destination, or a brand more broadly, is going to act to slow the economy and markets.
That should be good for rates, but all the hope about deficit reduction seems to be diminishing. Much of what I think would be required to make a pivot successful will involve spending.
I think that keeps bonds in a range (maybe a wide range of 4.1% to 4.5% on 10s) but a range, nonetheless. At the moment, the risk of breaking out of this range is to the higher yield side. I see more headline risk to bonds than optimism, especially on the deficit side of the equation.
Equities will suffer, in dribs and drabs, if the U.S. doesn’t back down on what we hope to achieve in trade negotiations.
To me, it comes down to undoing a lot on the trade front and pivoting sharply to doing what is in primarily U.S. control.
The rate at which announcements shaping the geopolitical environment, the economic environment, and the investing landscape is staggering.
Hope you have been able to use the long weekend to regroup and get ready for more! And hopefully it is Dealpalooza time – we could all use that!

A Daily Caller News Foundation investigation has potentially uncovered why the far-left mayor stands with illegal aliens and not with bolstering national security after the disastrous Biden-Harris regime&apos;s migrant invasion:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has stopped funding for a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/strong&gt; that received an award during the Biden administration, the company making the vaccine said on April 16.&lt;/p&gt;

Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia-based &lt;strong&gt;Geovax said that the stop-work order from HHS went into effect on April 11 &lt;/strong&gt;and affected an award of some $24.3 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), an HHS component that was placed in charge of the Biden administration’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-admin-launches-5-billion-effort-to-develop-new-covid-19-vaccines-therapies-5185303&quot;&gt;Project NextGen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;We had no prior indication that the notice was forthcoming&lt;/strong&gt;. We were surprised by the notice as both ourselves and our external contractors and consultants were making good progress and had a seemingly productive working relationship with the technical team at BARDA,” David Dodd, Geovax’s president and CEO, said at a conference on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to Dodd, the financial impact of the canceled funding on the company will be less than $750,000 annually for overhead and personnel costs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stop work order came about five months before the phase 2b portion of the clinical trial was scheduled to start enrolling participants, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We assume, from what we can determine, that the contract termination is resulting from the ongoing government efficiency efforts under the new administration,” Dodd said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An official with HHS told The Epoch Times in an email, “The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago when there are other emerging public health threats that we can better prioritize resources for.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the department and other agencies have been cutting staffers and programs deemed wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials in June 2024 announced the award to Geovax to conduct the phase 2b clinical trial for the vaccine, which BARDA described at the time as a novel candidate “that may provide broader, longer protection.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project NextGen was awarding $5 billion in funding for the next generation of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and tests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GEO-CM04S1, GeoVax’s vaccine, will still be developed, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We do not anticipate any significant changes to our ongoing operations resulting from the contract termination,” Dodd said, adding later that they “remain committed to GEO-CM04S1 as a critically needed next-generation COVID-19 vaccine providing [the] potential of a more robust immune response against emerging variants.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HHS previously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/hhs-pauses-multi-million-dollar-contract-to-develop-new-covid-19-vaccine-5816987&quot;&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a stop-work order for another COVID-19 vaccine, made by Vaxart, that received funding through Project NextGen. An HHS spokesperson told The Epoch Times in February that the order was issued several days before 10,000 people were scheduled to start clinical trials for the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Four years of the Biden administration’s failed oversight have made it necessary to review agreements for vaccine production, including Vaxart’s,&lt;/strong&gt;” Kennedy told Fox News at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, the Food and Drug Administration, another office inside HHS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/fda-deadline-for-novavaxs-covid-19-vaccine-passes-without-decision-5836120&quot;&gt;did not decide&lt;/a&gt; whether to license Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine, which is under emergency authorization, before a deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/health-secretary-shares-concerns-about-efficacy-of-novavax-covid-19-vaccine-after-fda-delay-5840356&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that officials are looking at the vaccine while alleging that single-antigen vaccines have never worked for respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novavax has said the vaccine is effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tracy Hoeg, a special assistant to Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, told a panel meeting this week that the administration will provide an update on the Novavax vaccine soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallup conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/659534/trump-first-quarter-approval-rating-below-average.aspx&quot;&gt;new poll&lt;/a&gt; in the first half of April, finding that Americans&apos; confidence in Democratic congressional leadership has plummeted to an abysmal 25%—about nine points below the previous low of 34% recorded in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Democratic leadership&apos;s latest 25% confidence rating is an all-time low for the group — well below the previous 34% low recorded in 2023 and the average of 45% since 2001&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; Gallup wrote in a report, adding, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Confidence ratings were last at the majority level in 2009 for Democratic congressional leaders and in 2003 for Republican congressional leaders&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;stunning collapse in public trust&lt;/strong&gt; toward congressional Dems comes as no surprise given socialists &lt;strong&gt;Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been flying around the country in private jets&lt;/strong&gt; to &quot;Fight Oligarchy,&quot; and &lt;strong&gt;Maryland&apos;s far-left Senator Chris Van Hollen&lt;/strong&gt; wasted taxpayer funds on a trip to meet with an MS-13 gangster (FTO designation) at an El Salvadorian resort. &lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>Confidence In Democratic Leadership Sinks To Record Low As Party Implodes 

            
The Democratic Party remains rudderless following last November&apos;s election setbacks, when Republicans regained control of both the White House and the Senate, while narrowly holding onto their House majority. Now, a new poll shows confidence in the Democratic Party&apos;s congressional leadership has collapsed, sinking to record lows. 
Gallup conducted a new poll in the first half of April, finding that Americans&apos; confidence in Democratic congressional leadership has plummeted to an abysmal 25%—about nine points below the previous low of 34% recorded in 2023.
&quot;Democratic leadership&apos;s latest 25% confidence rating is an all-time low for the group — well below the previous 34% low recorded in 2023 and the average of 45% since 2001,&quot; Gallup wrote in a report, adding, &quot;Confidence ratings were last at the majority level in 2009 for Democratic congressional leaders and in 2003 for Republican congressional leaders.&quot; 



The stunning collapse in public trust toward congressional Dems comes as no surprise given socialists Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been flying around the country in private jets to &quot;Fight Oligarchy,&quot; and Maryland&apos;s far-left Senator Chris Van Hollen wasted taxpayer funds on a trip to meet with an MS-13 gangster (FTO designation) at an El Salvadorian resort.

What an epic mess the Democratic Party has become—rife with hate, violence, and a relentless push of anti-American propaganda.
Americans want peace and prosperity—the era of Democrats waging 15 years of hybrid warfare through color revolutions and manufactured chaos has come to an abrupt end. 
This raises a very important question: Where does the Democratic Party&apos;s allegiance truly lie? Is it with America First—or somewhere else entirely?

&lt;p&gt;You likely already know from reading &lt;em&gt;Racket &lt;/em&gt;that &lt;strong&gt;the Biden administration was very active in targeting misinformation and disinformation, even as it engaged in those practices.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Racket’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitterfiles.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Twitter Files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and other reporting have extensively documented many of the anti-disinformation and misinformation programs and organizations that the federal government supported, &lt;strong&gt;like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.racket.news/p/big-brother-is-flagging-you&quot;&gt;Election Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.racket.news/p/anti-disinformation-is-a-partisan?utm_source=publication-search&quot;&gt;Cyber Threat Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (CTI League), and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.racket.news/p/foia-files-arizona-state-university?utm_source=publication-search&quot;&gt;Center on Narrative, Disinformation and Strategic Influence&lt;/a&gt; at Arizona State.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the number of grants? We didn’t know that. Now we do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefp.com/p/joe-biden-made-600-grants-to-stop-disinformation-misinformation-donald-trump-cancels-awards&quot;&gt;The Free Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reports that since 2017, the federal government has awarded about &lt;strong&gt;800 grants to counter mis/disinformation — and the Biden administration is responsible for more than 600 of them&lt;/strong&gt;. The 800 grants amount to more than $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings by reporters Gabe Kaminsky and Madeleine Rowley are based on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://liber-net.org/federal-awards&quot;&gt;new database&lt;/a&gt; of anti-mis/disinformation programs. The database was created by the free speech advocacy group &lt;a href=&quot;https://liber-net.org/&quot;&gt;liber-net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;A large number of these projects cynically employed the ‘misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation’ framework to counter their political adversaries, with U.S. government funding making it possible&lt;/strong&gt;,” liber-net’s director, Andrew Lowenthal, told the &lt;em&gt;Free Press&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump signed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/&quot;&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; on his first day in office that accused the Biden administration of violating free speech rights “under the guise” of combatting misinformation, disinformation and malinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Kaminsky and Rowley found that several of the programs were continuing under the Trump administration — at least until they started asking about the grants, as Kaminsky explains to &lt;em&gt;Racket&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We reached out to agencies to understand if these programs would continue under President Trump. What we found was a groundswell of federal officials taking the information and letting us know that they were either terminating the programs, investigating them, or adjusting internal policies as to how they characterize some of these programs to ensure alignment with the President&apos;s executive order on “restoring freedom of speech and ending federal censorship” that he signed on his first day in office. Some agencies, however, didn&apos;t respond, or, in the case of the National Science Foundation, declined to comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one example the &lt;em&gt;Free Press&lt;/em&gt; cites, NIH director Jay Bhattacharya sent an email marked “URGENT” to employees to investigate grants and contracts related to “fighting misinformation or disinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Free Press&lt;/em&gt; found several dozen grants that have since been canceled, such as $683,000 awarded to UC-Irvine in December.&lt;/strong&gt; The money would have gone toward studying the influence of social media and “misinformation on vaccine acceptance among black and Latinx individuals.” The study would have done that by enrolling 500 people who follow vaccine-hesitant influencers on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most mis/disinformation grants occurred under Biden, they started with some regularity during the first Trump administration. Here’s a graphic from liber-net that shows how the number of grants ballooned from Trump to Biden:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/https-3A-2F-2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com-2Fpublic-2Fimages-2Fef21d134-3795-41c5-9b59-cac30381e137_747x459.jpg?itok=7dHlUtqA&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/https-3A-2F-2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com-2Fpublic-2Fimages-2Fef21d134-3795-41c5-9b59-cac30381e137_747x459.jpg?itok=7dHlUtqA&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;cfc316ae-db73-470e-b525-507b8abcc6ef&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;307&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/https-3A-2F-2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com-2Fpublic-2Fimages-2Fef21d134-3795-41c5-9b59-cac30381e137_747x459.jpg?itok=7dHlUtqA&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organizations that receive grants typically dole out portions of the money to other organizations. Kaminsky explains how they work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe Kaminsky:&lt;/strong&gt; Like many federal programs, there are often subgrantees or subcontractors. So, while Maddie Rowley and I found that the Biden administration had awarded north of 600 grants and contracts to outside organizations, that number only accounts for primary awards. Take the $2 million that the Department of State awarded in 2023 to the Vermont-based NGO World Learning to, in its telling, “support the Armenian media sector&apos;s overall resilience to disinformation.” For that program, which ended in February 2025, World Learning dished out a sub-award of $275,219, or 13% of the primary award, to the Poynter Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for Poynter, that&apos;s nothing new. For example, I reported last year that Poynter had received a sub-award from the State Department&apos;s since-shuttered Global Engagement Center—which Republicans accused of censoring conservatives in the United States. Poynter received the GEC funding via the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, a London-based entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greg Collard: Although most grants were during the Biden administration, they were also awarded during the first Trump administration. Was there a difference in the types of grants that were awarded?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GK:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-2017 is really when these programs were kicked into gear, speeding up dramatically under Biden. The same grantees and contractors that ended up receiving large amounts in funding under Biden often had initially received some during the first Trump administration. As to why that was is I think a mix of Republicans being in the dark as to the programs, and—as was evident broadly across the first Trump administration—there being agencies that sort of operated how they desired irrespective of Trump&apos;s stated policies. Trump did not know how Washington worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I would say that the descriptions of programs on federal documents under Biden was a notable difference—as some appeared to more specifically align with the ideological priorities of the Democrats: using terms like “racial equity,” “Latinx,” or other left-leaning terminology championed by the Biden administration. Under Trump 1.0, in other words, the anti-misinformation circus quietly gained a foothold in the U.S. by advertising itself in broad strokes that, in theory, many might agree with: countering extremism or online harassment, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in practice, the programs were far more complicated and often partisan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Active Grants&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many anti mis/disinformation programs have been shut down, many remain active — including the largest grant: a $979 million award to military contractor Peraton, courtesy of the Department of Defense. Peraton landed the grant in 2021 to help the U.S. Central Command “counter misinformation,” liber-net’s Lowenthal writes in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://networkaffects.substack.com/p/federal-government-awards&quot;&gt;Substack post&lt;/a&gt; about the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That grant alone easily makes the Defense Department the largest funder of mis-disinformation grants from 2016 to 2024. USAID was the second-largest funder at $149 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smaller grants also remain active. One the Free Press cites is $6.8 million in multiple grants to the University of Washington for literary resources that help “rural communities and black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) communities” identify misinformation. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_2230616_4900&quot;&gt;grant description&lt;/a&gt; says misinformation is a “growing threat to American democracy,” and that “Solutions must not only provide the public with skills for determining the truthfulness of claims, but must also provide resources for addressing the social and emotional impacts of misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;

Racket’s Twitter Files and other reporting have extensively documented many of the anti-disinformation and misinformation programs and organizations that the federal government supported, like the Election Integrity Project, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI League), and the Center on Narrative, Disinformation and Strategic Influence at Arizona State.
But the number of grants? We didn’t know that. Now we do.
The Free Press reports that since 2017, the federal government has awarded about 800 grants to counter mis/disinformation — and the Biden administration is responsible for more than 600 of them. The 800 grants amount to more than $1.4 billion.

      <title>LA County Quality Of Life Index Stuck At A 10-Year Low; New Survey Finds</title>

      <content>&lt;span property=&quot;schema:name&quot; class=&quot;field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;LA County Quality Of Life Index Stuck At A 10-Year Low; New Survey Finds&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div property=&quot;schema:text&quot; class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles County residents have plenty to worry about amid a &lt;strong&gt;wildfire recovery effort, federal immigration crackdowns, and persistent homelessness,&lt;/strong&gt; but what most concerns them is the &lt;strong&gt;cost of living&lt;/strong&gt;, according to an annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lewis.ucla.edu/programs/data/qualityoflife/&quot;&gt;UCLA survey&lt;/a&gt; released on April 16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10th Annual Quality of Life Index (QLI) &lt;a href=&quot;https://ucla.app.box.com/s/5hq7trv75z30snqjidfmj2ufd2h6ctpc&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; polled 1,400 county residents between Feb. 23 and March 9, and found widespread frustration with the high cost of living, including increasing prices of groceries and household items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey, conducted by UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Affairs, found that &lt;strong&gt;concern over the high cost of living has kept the QLI at a lowly 53, the same as last year. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That number represents the lowest level in the survey’s history. In 2016, the QLI came in at 59.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Meanwhile, the salience of [the cost of living category] has risen to its highest-ever point in this index, and is joined by a growing concern about jobs and the economy,” said the survey, which was prepared by Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz &amp; Associates (FM3 Research). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The combination represents fundamental bread-and-butter issues that are the biggest explainers of the longer-term lukewarm attitudes toward life in Los Angeles County.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-image-external-href=&quot;&quot; data-image-href=&quot;/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2887%29_5.jpg?itok=Fp4XPoua&quot; data-link-option=&quot;0&quot; href=&quot;https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2887%29_5.jpg?itok=Fp4XPoua&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;483305cf-cd31-492e-a09c-85368d3f3ca2&quot; data-responsive-image-style=&quot;inline_images&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;inline-images image-style-inline-images&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2887%29_5.jpg?itok=Fp4XPoua&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/survey-finds-la-county-quality-of-life-index-stuck-at-a-10-year-low-5843827?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Kimberley Hayek reports for The Epoch Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;more than two-fifths of respondents claimed to know someone who lost a home or business in the January wildfires.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional 23 percent, including those who live relatively far from the burn areas, such as the northern part of the county and the South Bay, claimed to know someone affected. Meanwhile, 14 percent of respondents said they lost significant income due to the fires, while another 13 percent said they incurred a nonsignificant loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than half of respondents said they wore a mask to avoid smoke, volunteered or donated to help victims, and feared having to evacuate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“While the percentage of residents who lost income is lower than the percentages of those who experienced other impacts, it still represents millions of Angelenos,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;said the survey, which found that Latinos, younger residents, lower income earners, and those working part-time jobs were disproportionately affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eighty-nine percent of county residents agree that homeowners who lost their property in the fires should be permitted to rebuild at the same locations. In 2019, when residents were asked the same question in the wake of the Woolsey Fire near Simi Valley, 76 percent agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Both numbers are high, but suggest that the geographic breadth of the [January] fires, the extent of the destruction and the collateral impacts they had on a wide swath of the county significantly influenced this year’s results,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the survey said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Palisades and Eaton fires this year destroyed more than 16,000 structures; the Woolsey fire destroyed 1,600, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fire.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty-two percent of county residents said they would generally be OK with increased taxes for improved wildfire response. Younger residents, Latinos, and Asians were most open to the proposal. Whites and African Americans were evenly split on the idea, which did not include specifics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attitudes toward the Los Angeles mayor were affected by the wildfires, the survey said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, just 37 percent of respondents view Mayor Karen Bass favorably, with 49 percent viewing her unfavorably. That’s a reversal from 2024, when 42 percent viewed her favorably and 32 percent unfavorably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The wildfires that raged in Altadena and Pacific Palisades in January are the story of this year’s survey,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;said Zev Yaroslavsky, director of the Luskin School’s Los Angeles Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These catastrophic events have left devastating physical and psychological impacts in their wake,” said the former county supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Although the primary victims are those who lost their lives, homes and possessions, millions of other Angelenos have been touched by these terrifying events in myriad ways. These impacts cross geographic, economic and racial lines that can only be described as a shared trauma across Los Angeles County.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cost of Living&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The county’s high cost of living has become a major source of frustration for residents. Three-quarters of respondents chose it as the most important category affecting their quality of life. Among the subcategories, the cost of housing remains the leader, but the costs of groceries and household items rose in importance, as did taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The overall satisfaction score on our QLI index is stuck for one main reason—the impact of the high cost of living,” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;said Paul Maslin, a public opinion and polling expert with FM3 Research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Those concerns were the highest in terms of importance of any category we’ve measured in the last decade. And cost of living continues to be the lowest rating category in terms of satisfaction.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Immigration and deportation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forty-four percent of county residents fear that a member of their family or a friend could face deportation by federal authorities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, 37 percent expressed such a fear at the start of Trump’s first administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latinos are most likely to feel this way at 54 percent.&lt;/strong&gt; By age group, residents aged 18-29 and 30-39 are the most likely to fear a member of their family or friend could be deported at 57 percent and 52 percent, respectively. They are also most likely to believe that the city and county governments should not cooperate with the federal government’s current deportation policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The new administration in Washington has once again brought the question of immigration and deportation to the fore,” Yaroslavsky said. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This is very much an issue that is front and center on the minds of a large part of our county’s population.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Homelessness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homelessness remains at or near the top of concerns for residents,&lt;/strong&gt; though for the first time in a while, the portion who believe the homelessness problems are worsening has declined by 8 percentage points. In 2024, 60 percent thought the problem was growing worse. In the 2025 survey, 52 percent thought so. Yet &lt;strong&gt;only 10 percent believe the situation is getting better.&lt;/strong&gt; That number was the same in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

      <contentSnippet>LA County Quality Of Life Index Stuck At A 10-Year Low; New Survey Finds

            
Los Angeles County residents have plenty to worry about amid a wildfire recovery effort, federal immigration crackdowns, and persistent homelessness, but what most concerns them is the cost of living, according to an annual UCLA survey released on April 16.
The 10th Annual Quality of Life Index (QLI) survey polled 1,400 county residents between Feb. 23 and March 9, and found widespread frustration with the high cost of living, including increasing prices of groceries and household items.
The survey, conducted by UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Affairs, found that concern over the high cost of living has kept the QLI at a lowly 53, the same as last year. 
That number represents the lowest level in the survey’s history. In 2016, the QLI came in at 59.
“Meanwhile, the salience of [the cost of living category] has risen to its highest-ever point in this index, and is joined by a growing concern about jobs and the economy,” said the survey, which was prepared by Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz &amp; Associates (FM3 Research). 
“The combination represents fundamental bread-and-butter issues that are the biggest explainers of the longer-term lukewarm attitudes toward life in Los Angeles County.”



As Kimberley Hayek reports for The Epoch Times, more than two-fifths of respondents claimed to know someone who lost a home or business in the January wildfires. 
An additional 23 percent, including those who live relatively far from the burn areas, such as the northern part of the county and the South Bay, claimed to know someone affected. Meanwhile, 14 percent of respondents said they lost significant income due to the fires, while another 13 percent said they incurred a nonsignificant loss.
More than half of respondents said they wore a mask to avoid smoke, volunteered or donated to help victims, and feared having to evacuate.
“While the percentage of residents who lost income is lower than the percentages of those who experienced other impacts, it still represents millions of Angelenos,” said the survey, which found that Latinos, younger residents, lower income earners, and those working part-time jobs were disproportionately affected.
Eighty-nine percent of county residents agree that homeowners who lost their property in the fires should be permitted to rebuild at the same locations. In 2019, when residents were asked the same question in the wake of the Woolsey Fire near Simi Valley, 76 percent agreed.
“Both numbers are high, but suggest that the geographic breadth of the [January] fires, the extent of the destruction and the collateral impacts they had on a wide swath of the county significantly influenced this year’s results,” the survey said.
The Palisades and Eaton fires this year destroyed more than 16,000 structures; the Woolsey fire destroyed 1,600, according to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Fifty-two percent of county residents said they would generally be OK with increased taxes for improved wildfire response. Younger residents, Latinos, and Asians were most open to the proposal. Whites and African Americans were evenly split on the idea, which did not include specifics.
Attitudes toward the Los Angeles mayor were affected by the wildfires, the survey said.
For example, just 37 percent of respondents view Mayor Karen Bass favorably, with 49 percent viewing her unfavorably. That’s a reversal from 2024, when 42 percent viewed her favorably and 32 percent unfavorably.
“The wildfires that raged in Altadena and Pacific Palisades in January are the story of this year’s survey,” said Zev Yaroslavsky, director of the Luskin School’s Los Angeles Initiative.
“These catastrophic events have left devastating physical and psychological impacts in their wake,” said the former county supervisor.
“Although the primary victims are those who lost their lives, homes and possessions, millions of other Angelenos have been touched by these terrifying events in myriad ways. These impacts cross geographic, economic and racial lines that can only be described as a shared trauma across Los Angeles County.”

“Those concerns were the highest in terms of importance of any category we’ve measured in the last decade. And cost of living continues to be the lowest rating category in terms of satisfaction.”
Immigration and deportation
Forty-four percent of county residents fear that a member of their family or a friend could face deportation by federal authorities.
In 2017, 37 percent expressed such a fear at the start of Trump’s first administration.
Latinos are most likely to feel this way at 54 percent.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The deflation of asset bubbles and higher costs are foreseeable, but the magnitude of each is unpredictable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the rise of financialized asset bubbles as the source of our &quot;growth,&quot; family home went from shelter to speculative asset.&lt;/strong&gt; This transition accelerated as financialization (turning everything into a financial commodity to be leveraged and sold globally for a quick profit) spread into the once-staid housing sector in the early 2000s. (See chart of housing bubbles #1 and #2 below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where buying a home once meant putting down roots and insuring a stable cost of shelter, housing became a speculative asset to be snapped up and sold as prices soared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The short-term vacation rental (STVR) boom added fuel to the speculative fire over the past decade&lt;/strong&gt; as huge profits could be generated by assembling an STVR mini-empire of single-family homes that were now rented to tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that housing has become unaffordable to the majority and the costs of ownership are stair-stepping higher, housing has become a liability.&lt;/strong&gt; I covered the increases in costs of ownership in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oftwominds.com/blognov24/cost-of-ownership11-24.html&quot;&gt;The Cost of Owning a Home Is Soaring&lt;/a&gt; 11/11/24).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sums of money now required to own, insure and maintain a house are eye-watering.&lt;/strong&gt; Annual home insurance for many is now a five-figure sum; property taxes in many states is also a five-figure sum. As for maintenance, as I discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oftwominds.com/blogapr25/housing-quality4-25.html&quot;&gt;This Nails It: The Doom Loop of Housing Construction Quality&lt;/a&gt;, the decline in quality of housing and the rising costs of repair make buying a house a potentially unaffordable venture should repairs costing tens of thousands of dollars become necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major repairs can now cost what previous generations paid for an entire house, and no, this isn&apos;t just inflation; it&apos;s the result of the decline of quality across the board and the gutting of labor skills to cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I often note, the insurance industry is not a charity, and to maintain profits as payouts for losses explode higher, rates have to climb for everyone--and more for those in regions that are now viewed as high-risk due to massive losses in fires, hurricanes, wind storms, flooding, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All credit-asset bubbles pop, and that inevitable deflation of home valuations will take away the speculative punchbowl.

      <contentSnippet>The Family Home: From Shelter To Asset To Liability

            
Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,
The deflation of asset bubbles and higher costs are foreseeable, but the magnitude of each is unpredictable.
With the rise of financialized asset bubbles as the source of our &quot;growth,&quot; family home went from shelter to speculative asset. This transition accelerated as financialization (turning everything into a financial commodity to be leveraged and sold globally for a quick profit) spread into the once-staid housing sector in the early 2000s. (See chart of housing bubbles #1 and #2 below).
Where buying a home once meant putting down roots and insuring a stable cost of shelter, housing became a speculative asset to be snapped up and sold as prices soared.
The short-term vacation rental (STVR) boom added fuel to the speculative fire over the past decade as huge profits could be generated by assembling an STVR mini-empire of single-family homes that were now rented to tourists.
Now that housing has become unaffordable to the majority and the costs of ownership are stair-stepping higher, housing has become a liability. I covered the increases in costs of ownership in The Cost of Owning a Home Is Soaring 11/11/24). Articles like this one are increasingly common:
&apos;I feel trapped&apos;: how home ownership has become a nightmare for many Americans: Scores in the US say they&apos;re grappling with raised mortgage and loan interest rates and exploding insurance premiums.
