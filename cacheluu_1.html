Elon Musk said on Tesla's latest earnings call that his role in the Trump administration is winding down and that he will be returning his attention to Tesla, a move that allows Musk to turn the corner from a "dark chapter" that accompanied a disastrous quarter for the EV maker, Wedbush analysts Dan Ives and Sam Brandeis say in a research note. They view the call as a turning point in the Tesla story. This was an off-ramp for Tesla to escape the global brand damage, political firestorm and chaos of the past few months, the analysts say.

(From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:59:33 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915057885144371590#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 6) To be clear: all these housing markets still have some issues. Particularly, outbound migration. They all lost people during pandemic, and still might be losing some people today.

But in terms of fundamentals (home prices to income, and to rent) they are well-priced. And historically affordable.

Indicating we could be seeing a renaissance for the legacy big city housing markets the next 5 years. Especially if return to office mandates keep happening. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:59:14 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915057496017752287#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 5) I think this next one is my favorite, though. Cook County in Chicago.

In the last bubble, prices were trading at 5.2x incomes in Chicago.

Then there was a correction. And since then, values have kept pace with incomes, and today's 3.7x multiple is one of the cheapest in the country for a major city. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:57:41 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915057082417455381#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 4) Here's another example: Suffolk County, MA (Boston).

The Home/Value income ratio in Boston is 7.6x. today. Which is a hair below it's long-term 20-year average.

Inidcating that the growth in incomes has kept up with the growth in prices (there was actually a slight correction in prices in Boston the last 2 years). (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:56:03 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915056789864984771#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 3) To be clear: Manhattan is still expensive. In fact, it's one of the 5 most expensive housing markets in America.

However, it is cheap today compared to its historical norms. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:54:53 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915056602169659580#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 2) The average 20-year home price/income ratio in Manhattan is 14.4.

Meaning homes/condos typically trade for 14x median income.

Yet today, they're trading for 10.8x median income.

The lowest multiple in decades. Indicating that the market is undervalued. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:54:08 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915056270534738237#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 1) DC might be an exception given how the federal workforce is getting cut.

But in general, home values in these areas are trading at very reasonable levels compared to incomes.

For instance, take a look at Manhattan. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:52:49 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915055965705031958#m" target="_blank">Here are the counties in America that are "undervalued" in terms of home prices to income.

Manhattan - 25% undervalued
Bronx - 22%
DC - 18%
New Orelans - 11%
San Francisco- 11%
Queens - 5%
Brooklyn - 4%
Chicago - 3%
Boston - 2%

All legacy, big city housing markets for most part. They struggled during pandemic and lost people. But now they could be in for a turn-around.

Real estate is the cheapest it's been in these areas in decades. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:51:36 GMT</time></li>

    <li><a href="https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1915007666604175549#m" target="_blank">Retail investors were just cheated:

Yesterday at 12:00 PM ET, US Treasury Secretary Bessent said he sees "de-escalation with China" and the current situation is "unsustainable."

These comments were provided at a CLOSED-DOOR investor summit hosted by JP Morgan.

This summit was not open to the public or to the media.

Then, at 5:18 PM ET, President Trump said tariffs on China "will not be as high as 145%."

Bessent effectively told a closed-group of Wall Street investors that de-escalation with China was coming BEFORE the public knew.

The result was a move of +5% in S&P 500 futures, for a total of +$2.2 TRILLION of market cap.

Investors at the JP Morgan event were able to front-run these headlines.

But I think it could be poised for a big rebound soon.

The market is the cheapest it's been in decades relative to income and rent.

    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1914433331116007870#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 3) The reason is that home values actually corrected in Manhattan by around 20% from the peak in mid-2022.

It's the 8th most expensive county in America, and the only one located outside California.

Typical apartment rent is $5,091/month, or $61,000 per year.

The resulting home value/rent ratio in Manhattan is 18.5, the lowest it's been in 20+ years.
