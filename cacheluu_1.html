As a result, the 4-week moving average jumped to ~$1.2 billion, the highest since the 2020 pandemic.

During this time, the high-yield corporate bond ETF, $HYG, and the investment-grade corporate bond ETF, $LQD, have fallen by -1.2% and -0.9%, respectively.

Meanwhile, high-yield corporate bond spreads have risen 1.5 percentage points over the last 2 months, to 4.16%, near the highest in 2 years.

However, foreign investors still own ~$4.4 trillion, or 27%, of the total US corporate bond market, according to BofA.

The copper-to-gold ratio has dropped to its lowest level in at least 40 years.

This ratio has halved over the last 3 years.

The decline has accelerated over the last month as gold prices have risen +9% while copper prices have plummeted -8%.

A rapidly falling copper-to-gold ratio has historically signaled weakening global economic activity.

Previous major downturns in this indicator were seen during 2020 and 2008.

Home payments have now surged by ~$570/month, or 25%, over the last 3 years.

The increase was driven by a combination of rising median home prices and rising interest rates.

The median home sales price increased 2.6% year-over-year, to $387,000, to its highest since August 2024.

Meanwhile, mortgage rates are rising back above 7% as treasury yields surge.

The housing market remains historically expensive. (From TKL)</a><br/><time>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:58:00 GMT</time></li>

Gold funds posted a record ~$8 billion in net inflows last week.

This is double the record weekly inflows seen during the 2020 pandemic.

As a result, the 4-week moving average of inflows jumped to ~$4 billion, also an all-time high.

Gold prices have now rallied 29% this year, the best year-to-date gain since 1974.

In fact, in less than 5 months, gold has already exceeded its 27% return seen in 2024.

China has just announced that they will be pulling back from US private equity investments.

Chinese state-backed funds are halting new investments in US PE firms due to government pressure.

According to PE executives, funds like China Investment Corporation (CIC) have already begun withdrawing planned commitments.

Chinese investors are also avoiding US-linked deals, even when managed by non-US based PE funds.

Just 24 hours ago, China warned they would retaliate against countries that cooperate with the US in ways that compromise their interests.

It's very clear what's happening here:

China is seeking to isolate the US through trade and investment.
