    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915057885144371590#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 6) To be clear: all these housing markets still have some issues. Particularly, outbound migration. They all lost people during pandemic, and still might be losing some people today.

But in terms of fundamentals (home prices to income, and to rent) they are well-priced. And historically affordable.

Indicating we could be seeing a renaissance for the legacy big city housing markets the next 5 years. Especially if return to office mandates keep happening. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:59:14 GMT</time></li>

In the last bubble, prices were trading at 5.2x incomes in Chicago.

Then there was a correction. And since then, values have kept pace with incomes, and today's 3.7x multiple is one of the cheapest in the country for a major city. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:57:41 GMT</time></li>

The Home/Value income ratio in Boston is 7.6x. today. Which is a hair below it's long-term 20-year average.

Inidcating that the growth in incomes has kept up with the growth in prices (there was actually a slight correction in prices in Boston the last 2 years). (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:56:03 GMT</time></li>

However, it is cheap today compared to its historical norms. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:54:53 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915056602169659580#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 2) The average 20-year home price/income ratio in Manhattan is 14.4.

Meaning homes/condos typically trade for 14x median income.

Yet today, they're trading for 10.8x median income.

The lowest multiple in decades. Indicating that the market is undervalued. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:54:08 GMT</time></li>

But in general, home values in these areas are trading at very reasonable levels compared to incomes.

For instance, take a look at Manhattan. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:52:49 GMT</time></li>
