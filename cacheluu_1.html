The ratio of companies where insiders purchased their own stock versus sold rose to 0.42 in April, the highest in 16 months.

In the first 2 weeks of April, 180 corporate insiders purchased their stock while 451 sold.

Over the last 30 days, 478 insiders bought while 1,041 insiders sold, bringing the ratio up to 0.46, according to Washington Service data.

However, the ratio of buyers to sellers is still more than 50% below the 1.0 recorded during the 2022 bear market.

Global leveraged equity funds attracted a record $14 billion in net inflows 2 weeks ago.

This is nearly TRIPLE the previous high posted during the 2020 pandemic.

Last week alone, US leveraged long ETFs saw a record $6.6 billion in inflows.

At the same time, the 3x leveraged Nasdaq 100 long ETF, $TQQQ, took in a whopping $2.3 billion.

The majority of inflows were driven by retail investors.

Home payments have now surged by ~$570/month, or 25%, over the last 3 years.

The increase was driven by a combination of rising median home prices and rising interest rates.

The median home sales price increased 2.6% year-over-year, to $387,000, to its highest since August 2024.

Meanwhile, mortgage rates are rising back above 7% as treasury yields surge.

China has just announced that they will be pulling back from US private equity investments.

Chinese state-backed funds are halting new investments in US PE firms due to government pressure.

According to PE executives, funds like China Investment Corporation (CIC) have already begun withdrawing planned commitments.

Chinese investors are also avoiding US-linked deals, even when managed by non-US based PE funds.

Just 24 hours ago, China warned they would retaliate against countries that cooperate with the US in ways that compromise their interests.

It's very clear what's happening here:

China is seeking to isolate the US through trade and investment.

Traders are bracing for major volatility after Tesla reports earnings Tuesday after the close. Options markets are pricing in a 9.7% swing, up or down, according to ORATS.

Tesla shares slid another 6% Monday, dragged down by trade-war fears. The stock is now down over 44% YTD, weighed by consumer backlash, Elon Musk‚Äôs ties to Trump, and a broader risk-off market. (From Walter Bloomberg)</a><br/><time>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 16:46:14 GMT</time></li>
