(From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:59:33 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915057885144371590#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 6) To be clear: all these housing markets still have some issues. Particularly, outbound migration. They all lost people during pandemic, and still might be losing some people today.

But in terms of fundamentals (home prices to income, and to rent) they are well-priced. And historically affordable.

Indicating we could be seeing a renaissance for the legacy big city housing markets the next 5 years. Especially if return to office mandates keep happening. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:59:14 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915057496017752287#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 5) I think this next one is my favorite, though. Cook County in Chicago.

In the last bubble, prices were trading at 5.2x incomes in Chicago.

Then there was a correction. And since then, values have kept pace with incomes, and today's 3.7x multiple is one of the cheapest in the country for a major city. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:57:41 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915057082417455381#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 4) Here's another example: Suffolk County, MA (Boston).

The Home/Value income ratio in Boston is 7.6x. today. Which is a hair below it's long-term 20-year average.

Inidcating that the growth in incomes has kept up with the growth in prices (there was actually a slight correction in prices in Boston the last 2 years). (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:56:03 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915056789864984771#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 3) To be clear: Manhattan is still expensive. In fact, it's one of the 5 most expensive housing markets in America.

However, it is cheap today compared to its historical norms. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:54:53 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915056602169659580#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 2) The average 20-year home price/income ratio in Manhattan is 14.4.

Meaning homes/condos typically trade for 14x median income.

Yet today, they're trading for 10.8x median income.

The lowest multiple in decades. Indicating that the market is undervalued. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:54:08 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915056270534738237#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 1) DC might be an exception given how the federal workforce is getting cut.

But in general, home values in these areas are trading at very reasonable levels compared to incomes.

For instance, take a look at Manhattan. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:52:49 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915055965705031958#m" target="_blank">Here are the counties in America that are "undervalued" in terms of home prices to income.

Manhattan - 25% undervalued
Bronx - 22%
DC - 18%
New Orelans - 11%
San Francisco- 11%
Queens - 5%
Brooklyn - 4%
Chicago - 3%
Boston - 2%

All legacy, big city housing markets for most part. They struggled during pandemic and lost people. But now they could be in for a turn-around.

Real estate is the cheapest it's been in these areas in decades. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:51:36 GMT</time></li>

The Trump administration is weighing major tariff cuts on Chinese imports—possibly by over 50%—to reduce trade tensions, sources say. No final decision has been made, and options remain open.

One idea is a tiered system:

🔸 35% tariffs on non-strategic items

🔸 100%+ tariffs on goods tied to national security

🔸 Phased in over five years

Trump confirmed Tuesday that his 145% tariffs could be reduced but “won’t be zero.” Markets reacted positively to the news.

China responded by signaling openness to talks but warned it won’t negotiate under U.S. threats. Some in Beijing see Trump’s shift as backing down. (From Walter Bloomberg)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:39:11 GMT</time></li>

But I think it could be poised for a big rebound soon.

The market is the cheapest it's been in decades relative to income and rent.

Suggesting a turnaround could be in the offering. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:40:06 GMT</time></li>

Creating an undervalued market. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:39:16 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1914433567431569677#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 4) Today's nominal price in Manhattan is about the same as it was in 2014. 

And barely above where it was in 2006. 

Evidence that this housing market has been on the struggle bus for a while. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:38:25 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1914433331116007870#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 3) The reason is that home values actually corrected in Manhattan by around 20% from the peak in mid-2022.

Moreover, Manhattan's housing market was also struggling prior to the pandemic.

So in terms of relative affordability, it has gained significantly. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:37:29 GMT</time></li>

The question is: how is it priced compared to its long-term norms?

And unquestionably, New York is the cheapest it's been to buy in decades. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:36:01 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1914432704374055108#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 1) Of course, Manhattan is still very expensive.

It's the 8th most expensive county in America, and the only one located outside California.

Typical home/condo value of $1.1 million. With associated mortgage payment of $7,500/month to buy. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:34:59 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1914431657832067429#m" target="_blank">Typical home (condo/co-op) value in Manhattan today is $1.1 million.

Typical apartment rent is $5,091/month, or $61,000 per year.

The resulting home value/rent ratio in Manhattan is 18.5, the lowest it's been in 20+ years.

Indicating Manhattan might actually be a good place to buy right now. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:30:50 GMT</time></li>
