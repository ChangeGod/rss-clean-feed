🔸 IIF calls the expected recession “manufactured,” driven by policy shifts—especially trade and migration under a possible Trump return—not an external shock like 2008 or COVID.

🔸 The U.S. economy may shrink by 0.8% in Q3 and 0.3% in Q4 2025, says the Institute of International Finance (IIF).

🔸 The Fed may cut rates six times through 2025, starting as early as June.

🔸 Core PCE inflation could rise to 4.6% by year-end (vs. 2.8% in Feb), driven partly by tariffs.

🔸 GDP growth in 2025 is expected to be just 0.8%.

🔸 Weakening consumer sentiment and slowing manufacturing suggest a downturn. (From Walter Bloomberg)</a><br/><time>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 11:40:53 GMT</time></li>
