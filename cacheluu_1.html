As a result, the 4-week moving average jumped to ~$1.2 billion, the highest since the 2020 pandemic.

During this time, the high-yield corporate bond ETF, $HYG, and the investment-grade corporate bond ETF, $LQD, have fallen by -1.2% and -0.9%, respectively.

Meanwhile, high-yield corporate bond spreads have risen 1.5 percentage points over the last 2 months, to 4.16%, near the highest in 2 years.

However, foreign investors still own ~$4.4 trillion, or 27%, of the total US corporate bond market, according to BofA.

Gold funds posted a record ~$8 billion in net inflows last week.

This is double the record weekly inflows seen during the 2020 pandemic.

As a result, the 4-week moving average of inflows jumped to ~$4 billion, also an all-time high.

Gold prices have now rallied 29% this year, the best year-to-date gain since 1974.

China has just announced that they will be pulling back from US private equity investments.

Chinese state-backed funds are halting new investments in US PE firms due to government pressure.

According to PE executives, funds like China Investment Corporation (CIC) have already begun withdrawing planned commitments.

Chinese investors are also avoiding US-linked deals, even when managed by non-US based PE funds.

Just 24 hours ago, China warned they would retaliate against countries that cooperate with the US in ways that compromise their interests.

It's very clear what's happening here:

China is seeking to isolate the US through trade and investment.
