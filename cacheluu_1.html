North American trade is set to be hit the hardest, while Asia and Europe will continue to see modest growth.

The WTO also highlights that if the US imposes higher reciprocal tariffs after a 90-day pause, global merchandise trade could drop by -1.5% this year.

Anti-U.S. sentiment over trade policy and fears of the immigration crackdown overreaching are already hurting tourism from overseas. After an adjustment for calendar timing, Easter travel to the U.S. is looking about 10% worse than last year's level, JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli writes. As a rough estimate, a 10% decline in foreign travel would subtract about 0.1% from GDP in 2025, Feroli concludes. The hit, of course, would be especially apparent in the hotels and restaurants sector, although foreigners are also important customers for educational institutions. In the past, when anti-U.S. sentiment has driven declines in tourism, such as at the start of the 2003 Iraq war, the tourism weakness has been sharp but short-lived.

    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915057885144371590#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 6) To be clear: all these housing markets still have some issues. Particularly, outbound migration. They all lost people during pandemic, and still might be losing some people today.

But in terms of fundamentals (home prices to income, and to rent) they are well-priced. And historically affordable.

Indicating we could be seeing a renaissance for the legacy big city housing markets the next 5 years. Especially if return to office mandates keep happening. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:59:14 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915057496017752287#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 5) I think this next one is my favorite, though. Cook County in Chicago.

In the last bubble, prices were trading at 5.2x incomes in Chicago.

Then there was a correction. And since then, values have kept pace with incomes, and today's 3.7x multiple is one of the cheapest in the country for a major city. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:57:41 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915057082417455381#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 4) Here's another example: Suffolk County, MA (Boston).

The Home/Value income ratio in Boston is 7.6x. today. Which is a hair below it's long-term 20-year average.

Inidcating that the growth in incomes has kept up with the growth in prices (there was actually a slight correction in prices in Boston the last 2 years). (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:56:03 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915056789864984771#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 3) To be clear: Manhattan is still expensive. In fact, it's one of the 5 most expensive housing markets in America.

However, it is cheap today compared to its historical norms. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:54:53 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915056602169659580#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 2) The average 20-year home price/income ratio in Manhattan is 14.4.

Meaning homes/condos typically trade for 14x median income.

Yet today, they're trading for 10.8x median income.

The lowest multiple in decades. Indicating that the market is undervalued. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:54:08 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915056270534738237#m" target="_blank">R to @nickgerli1: 1) DC might be an exception given how the federal workforce is getting cut.

But in general, home values in these areas are trading at very reasonable levels compared to incomes.

For instance, take a look at Manhattan. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:52:49 GMT</time></li>
    <li><a href="https://x.com/nickgerli1/status/1915055965705031958#m" target="_blank">Here are the counties in America that are "undervalued" in terms of home prices to income.

Manhattan - 25% undervalued
Bronx - 22%
DC - 18%
New Orelans - 11%
San Francisco- 11%
Queens - 5%
Brooklyn - 4%
Chicago - 3%
Boston - 2%

All legacy, big city housing markets for most part. They struggled during pandemic and lost people. But now they could be in for a turn-around.

Real estate is the cheapest it's been in these areas in decades. (From Nick Gerli_Realestate)</a><br/><time>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:51:36 GMT</time></li>
