During this time, the high-yield corporate bond ETF, $HYG, and the investment-grade corporate bond ETF, $LQD, have fallen by -1.2% and -0.9%, respectively.

Meanwhile, high-yield corporate bond spreads have risen 1.5 percentage points over the last 2 months, to 4.16%, near the highest in 2 years.

However, foreign investors still own ~$4.4 trillion, or 27%, of the total US corporate bond market, according to BofA.

The copper-to-gold ratio has dropped to its lowest level in at least 40 years.

This ratio has halved over the last 3 years.

The decline has accelerated over the last month as gold prices have risen +9% while copper prices have plummeted -8%.

A rapidly falling copper-to-gold ratio has historically signaled weakening global economic activity.

Previous major downturns in this indicator were seen during 2020 and 2008.

The ratio of companies where insiders purchased their own stock versus sold rose to 0.42 in April, the highest in 16 months.

In the first 2 weeks of April, 180 corporate insiders purchased their stock while 451 sold.

Over the last 30 days, 478 insiders bought while 1,041 insiders sold, bringing the ratio up to 0.46, according to Washington Service data.

However, the ratio of buyers to sellers is still more than 50% below the 1.0 recorded during the 2022 bear market.
